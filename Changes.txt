REVISION HISTORY
================

VERSION 3.6.2 - Patch 2, July 2025

Editor:
 - The multiline Text edit window can now be called for all the "free text" properties in the game,
   by pressing the "..." button.
 - "Edit Custom Properties" and "Edit property schema" dialogs are now resizable, and remember
   their size and position.
 - When making a game template Editor will now use an optional "template.files" file, if one is
   found in the project folder. This file should contain include/exclude filepath patterns,
   and lets include subfolders into the template too.
 - Fixed Editor application freezing at the Splash screen if any exception occured when
   starting up. Now it should close itself properly.
 - Fixed "Export sprites" dialog visual style and being cut on Windows 11.
 - Fixed script preprocessor not recognizing macros which begin with a underscore.
 - Fixed that error reports occuring when opening a room had only their first line displayed
   in a message box, instead of a full error message.
 - Fixed wrongly issued warnings about voice-over filenames not matching selected naming style.
 - Fixed that during a test game run new function names may still be auto-inserted into the
   object's event property when user clicks on "..." button (or double clicks the gui control),
   while actual functions won't be added to script, as the script is forbidden from being modified
   during game test.
 - Fixed that if there was already a function name inserted into a gui control's event property,
   but actual function not present in script, the function is not created when user double clicks
   the gui control.

Compiler:
 - Fixed error occuring when processing a global variable which type is an empty struct.

Script API:
 - Fixed default values for save slots range in FillSaveGameList(), RestoreGameDialog() and
   SaveGameDialog(), they did not match historical behavior of these functions. The default
   slots range is now 0-99.

Engine:
 - Fixed game refusing to load if a font file is not found, use font 0 as a fallback instead.
   (This restores a historical behavior, but now it works for any font, not only WFNs.)
 - Fixed characters being forcedly moved to a walkable area after a call to FaceLocation()
   or a similar function.
 - Fixed a single black frame displayed before the video when PlayVideo() is called.
 - Fixed "fade-out" transition could sometimes not play to the end.
 - Fixed mouse cursor and @OVERHOTSPOT@ labels displayed for 1 frame between fade-in and 
   "After fade-in" event, which could cause them flickering unexpectedly if "After fade-in"
   script contains blocking cutscene.
 - Fixed @OVERHOTSPOT@ labels not redrawing after blocking action ends if the cursor remains
   over the same hotspot where it was before the action.
 - Fixed game interface could become enabled for a single game frame each time right before the
   Dialog options are displayed. This could cause e.g. a "normal" cursor or @OVERHOTSPOT@ text to
   appear for the split second.
 - Fixed gui texts aligned to Bottom or Right had a position mistake in 1 pixel.
 - Fixed slightly broken slider's handle position for thin sliders with very small handle sprites.
 - Fixed SayAt() not being clamped at the screen width (as it was historically).
 - Fixed AudioClip.IsAvailable not working correctly.
 - Fixed sprite cache or texture cache not initializing properly if their size in config is
   assigned to a too large number. The cache sizes will be now correctly limited to the max
   possible size available to the current engine build (32-bit or 64-bit).

Compatibility:
 - Corrected a fix for the misaligned text centering on buttons in pre-3.6.0 games (the previous
   fix introduced in 3.6.2 Patch 1 happened to be breaking some other cases).

WinSetup:
 - If any of the cache sizes in config is set to a value not present in the option lists,
   the list will be assigned to the nearest matching value, instead of resetting to default.


VERSION 3.6.2 - Patch 1, June 2025

Editor:
 - On failed new font import do not replace the font with font 0 in preview, as that's confuses
   users and hides import errors.
 - Fixed an unhandled exception which occured on Text Parser panel when user pressed Enter while
   no item is selected.

Engine:
 - Try to detect incorrect argument types in string formatting functions such as String.Format,
   in attempt to avoid crashes when a '%s' format is used (this is still not 100% secure though).
 - Do not quit with error if a wrong GUI type is assigned as a "TextWindow GUI", display default
   message box instead and log a warning.
 - Fixed a crash occuring when reading Character.DestinationX/Y properties while the character
   is turning on spot after a call to FaceDirection.
 - Fixed a crash occuring when SpeechView is assigned a view that has no loops.
 - Fixed Lucas-Arts speech positioning mistake occuring, for example, when there's a big
   transparent GUI covering whole screen.
 - Fixed dialog options with no text, they were displayed and could be selected by player,
   which should not be happening.
 - Fixed Character.PlaceOnWalkableArea() and Room.NearestWalkableArea() returning wrong results
   if Room's mask resolution is not 1:1.
 - Fixed Direct3D and OpenGL renderers displaying sprites with occasional "magenta" pixels when
   "Smooth scaled sprites" setting is enabled but graphic filter is set to "Nearest-neighbour".

Compatibility:
 - Support detecting and loading game data from Linux game ports where it's called "agsgame.dat",
   and is created using an older version of the third-party "agspack" utility.
 - Disable smooth walk transition in pre-3.6.1 games, as apparently this breaks logic in some of
   them where precise walking coordinates and/or timing is required by scripts.
 - Fixed misaligned text centering on buttons in pre-3.6.0 games.


VERSION 3.6.2, May 2025

Common:
 - Event handler function are now allowed to be located in any script module.
 - New naming rule for the voice clips: full char name, followed by a number, separated by a dot,
   e.g. "RogerTheGreat.1234.ogg". The old rule may be enabled again by a switch in "Backwards
   Compatibility" settings.

Editor:
 - In "Start New Game Wizard" game template selection now displays template's description right
   in the dialog.
 - "Game statistics" now have Ctrl + F2 shortcut instead of F2.
 - F2 can be used for starting editing names of items in the Project Tree (ones that support that)
   and folders in the Sprite Manager.
 - Added "Game Speed" property in General Settings.
 - Added "Use old-style voice clip naming rule" property in General Settings, it lets to select
   whether the game should expect old-style voice clip filenames (4-letter char name followed by
   number) or the new one (full char name, followed by a number, separated by a dot).
 - In General Settings renamed "Override built-in inventory window click handling" option to the
   older variant "Handle inventory window clicks in script" (because it's easier to understand).
 - GUI selection in settings is now done using drop-down lists which list all eligible GUI types
   instead of having user to type GUI number. The setting will be automatically fixed if a GUI
   is removed.
 - Property Grid now displays Custom Properties right in the main properties list for each item
   that supports them.
 - Added "WrapText", "TextPaddingHorizontal", "TextPaddingVertical" properties to GUI Button.
 - GUI Labels can select full range of Alignment values in their TextAlignment property.
 - Added "TurnWhenFacing" property to Characters.
 - Textual GUI controls can now select "Null Font" as their font: this will prevent any text to be
   drawn even if one is assigned, and make it have zero size (when it matters).
 - Property Grid and Room's navigation bar now display object's description along with the script
   name on the drop-down list labels.
 - "Events" tab on the Properties Grid now has "ScriptModule" selection, which lets define in which
   module should the related script functions be generated and looked for. The GUI Controls use
   a ScriptModule set in their parent GUI, and Room events always has a fixed room script selected.
 - Added "Open Recent" submenu in the File menu.
 - Sync script editor's commands in Edit menu with the context menu.
 - Added "Toggle Line Comment" command to Edit menu for scripts.
 - More panes in the Editor are DPI-aware (rescale well with the system font scaling).
 - Editor tabs now display icons indicating their contents (may be disabled in Editor Preferences).
 - Room panel tabs now display room names.
 - Editor will now remember certain window states: "Sprite selector" window and splitter position,
   splitter position in "Sprite manager".
 - Support reordering folders in Project Explorer with drag & drop.
 - Support importing plain script files: ash, asc or both, - besides script modules (*.scm).
 - On "Color Finder" pane also display actual RGB values that the engine will use. They may be
   different from requested RGB, because historically engine limits drawing color's RGB precision
   to 16-bit.
 - Font's "SourceFilename" and "Font Size" properties now have buttons that let import another font
   file, or reimport same font with different size respectively, instead of clicking on a button on
   the preview window.
 - Added a readonly "ProjectFilename" property to Fonts, which displays their in-project file name.
 - Global Variables panel now allows to declare arrays.
 - Added "Controls transparency" slider to GUI edit pane.
 - Copy, paste and delete commands now apply to all the selected GUI controls in GUI editor.
 - When pasting a copied GUI control, Locked property of a new control will be turned off.
 - Support editing group properties for selected GUI controls.
 - Added a multiline Text edit window for Button and Label controls, that may be called by Ctrl+E,
   from context menu, or by pressing "..." button of the Text property in the Properties grid.
 - Support reordering folders in Sprite Manager with drag & drop.
 - Added "Replace source paths for sprites..." context menu command in Sprite Manager. This command
   allows to batch-replace parent folder for all sprite source paths, in case you moved original
   files from one folder to another.
 - Added "Palette index" selection for sprite's import transparency option.
 - Support importing 32-bit BMP files of extended formats (this support is formal at the moment,
   and does not guarantee that any of the extended data will be interpreted).
 - Support importing 1-bit (monochrome) and 4-bit images as sprites, room backgrounds and masks
   (converted to 8-bit).
 - Do not alter or clamp palette for 8-bit sprites imported in a 16/32-bit game.
 - Support importing indexed images which palettes contain translucent alpha as sprites with alpha.
 - Support importing indexed PNGs as room backgrounds and masks.
 - Added "Change Room Number" context menu command for the Rooms in Project Explorer.
 - When the room background size changes, reset room edges to defaults.
 - Removed obsolete "Copy walkable area mask to regions" command from the Room editor.
 - Improved scrolling of drop-down lists in the Room's navigation bar: made scroll buttons larger,
   and support mouse wheel.
 - In Room Editor, during any area drawing mode Ctrl + LMB now works as area picker regardless
   of the currently selected tool.
 - Added "Replace source paths for audio clips..." context menu command for the Audio node.
   This command allows to batch-replace parent folder for all clips' source paths, in case you
   moved original files from one folder to another.
 - Don't restrict compiling a voice-based lipsync if game has a Lucas-Arts style speech.
 - Do not delete previously built game exe from Compiled/Windows folder when testing a game
   from the editor.
 - Editor will now report any missing script functions that are assigned to events, but not
   present in script, as warnings when compiling the game.
 - Editor will now report any script functions that *look like* event functions, but not assigned
   to corresponding events, as warnings when compiling the game.
 - Editor will interrupt "Check for updates" process if it is taking too long with no progress.
 - Added "/maketemplate" command-line option that tells Editor to run, make template out of the
   said game, and quit.
 - Fixed Project Explorer refreshing when user changes names or descriptions of room objects.
 - Fixed importing indexed PNG as a sprite, previously Editor would mistakenly treat the source
   image as 32-bit.
 - Fixed importing GIFs with "palette 0 / N" transparency option would refer a palette color from
   each individual frame's palette rather than the original GIF palette, which could lead to wrong
   colors used as transparents.
 - Fixed importing 8-bit BMP sprites with no "Remap palette" and "Leave As Is" as a transparency
   option would still remap palette index 0 to the first found palette entry with Alpha 0,
   even if that's a filler entry not used by the image.
 - Fixed exporting room backgrounds was always writing a 32-bit image rather than using actual
   background's color depth.
 - Fixed Autocomplete failing in case of UNIX line endings in script file.
 - Fixed Autocomplete not giving correct results in case of a long chained access, i.e. something
   like "var[0].member.member".
 - Fixed Autocomplete giving wrong list of choices for wrong syntax cases like: indexed access of
   a type and non-array struct variable, member access of a static array.
 - Fixed Button getting resized to the image's size when user cancels different sprite assignment.
 - Fixed "Color Finder" and color properties were mapping a color number to RGB values with
   accuracy mistakes, resulting in slightly different values than the engine would use.
 - Fixed Font preview could crash the Editor with out of memory error in case of a very big font.
 - Fixed Editor refusing to open a project if one or more of the sections are missing in the file.
 - Fixed an unhandled exception occuring when rebuilding rooms if any script's header is missing.
 - Fixed a "unterminated string" error in Dialogs was not pointing to the actual error location.
 - Fixed double warning message when trying to close the Editor while a game test is running.
 - Fixed Editor may display a "save project" confirmation when run with "/compile" command-line
   parameter.

Scripting:
 - Dynamic arrays now have Length readonly property that returns their number of elements.
 - Support zero-length dynamic arrays. This may be useful if you need to have a dynamic array
   with no elements, but don't want to bother about checking a null pointer.

Script API:
 - Added eNullFont constant that lets assign or pass a "null font" to any property or function
   parameter which expects a font's ID. This "null font" will simply make any text not drawn
   and have no actual measurements (size, spacing, etc).
 - Added global events: eEventDialogStart, eEventDialogStop, eEventDialogRun,
   eEventDialogOptionsOpen, eEventDialogOptionsClose (these are handled in "on_event").
 - Events eEventGUIMouseDown and eEventGUIMouseUp now get additional parameters: mouse button,
   mouse x and y positions (relative to the exact GUI).
 - Expanded "on_mouse_click" callback, now supports two more parameters: click x,y coordinates.
 - Added RestoredSaveInfo struct which contains information about game save's contents, 
 - Support "validate_restored_save" callback, which lets user to validate restored saves with
   mismatching data and request cancellation or continuation of restoring this save.
 - Added Button.WrapText, TextPaddingHorizontal, TextPaddingVertical.
 - Added Character.Following property that returns another Character that this one follows after.
 - Added Character.TurnWhenFacing property.
 - Added Character.MoveStraight() complementing WalkStraight().
 - Added DateTime.CreateFromDate() and CreateFromRawTime().
 - Added static Dialog.CurrentDialog property and non-static ExecutedOption and AreOptionsDisplayed
   properties.
 - Added static Dialog.Stop() function, a OO-style alias to StopDialog().
 - Added RenderLayer enum, and optional "layers" parameter to DynamicSprite.CreateFromScreenShot(),
   that tells which of the game's render layers to capture when making a screenshot.
 - Added File.Copy() and File.Rename().
 - Added FileSortStyle and SortDirection enum, and File.GetFiles() function that returns a dynamic
   array of filenames found using certain pattern, and optionally sorted by name or time,
   in ascending or descending order.
 - Added File.GetFileTime() that returns file's modification time.
 - Added File.ReadFloat(), WriteFloat(), ReadRawFloat(), WriteRawFloat(), ReadRawBytes() and
   WriteRawBytes().
 - Added Game.InBlockingWait property, that tells whether game is waiting for any blocking action
   or a Wait* call to complete.
 - Added SaveGameSortStyle enum and Game.GetSaveSlots() function that returns a dynamic array
   of save slot indexes, optionally sorted in certain way.
 - Added Game.GetSaveSlotTime() that returns a time this save slot was last written.
 - Added Game.ScanSaveSlots() that scans a range of game saves and tests them for compatibility,
   using "validate_restored_save" too if it's present in user script.
   This action is not run immediately, but is scheduled to be executed after current script
   ends. It reports of scanning completion by sending eEventSavesScanComplete event.
 - Label.TextAlignment has now type Alignment, rather than HorizontalAlignment, and has
   full alignment range (both horizontal and vertical).
 - Added optional "fileSortStyle" and "sortDirection" parameters to ListBox.FillDirList().
 - Added optional save slot range (min/max), saveSortStyle and sortDirection parameters to
   ListBox.FillSaveGameList(). This lets to define the exact range of saves it should fill,
   and order them in desired way.
 - Added ListBox.FillSaveGameSlots(), which initializes a list of saves from a dynamic array
   of save slot indexes.
 - Added Object.DestinationX and DestinationY properties, complementing ones in Character.
 - Added Overlay.SetPosition() and SetSize() functions for convenience.
 - Added Room.BackgroundCount readonly property.
 - Added Room.NearestWalkableArea() that returns the nearest found point on a walkable area.
 - Added GetWalkBehindBase() function, complementing SetWalkBehindBase().
 - Added Speech.SpeakingCharacter that returns currently speaking character (for blocking speech).
 - Added GetTimerPos() that returns timer's position (remaining time), in ticks.
 - Added CopySaveSlot() and MoveSaveSlot(), which moves existing save to another slot.
 - Added optional save slot range (min/max) parameters to RestoreGameDialog() and SaveGameDialog().
 - Added optional "sprite" parameter to SaveGameSlot(), that lets to pass a number of an arbitrary
   sprite to write into this save instead of a standard "screenshot".
 - Added optional "width", "height" and "layer" parameters to SaveScreenShot().
   SaveScreenShot() now accepts paths containing standard file tokens ($SAVEGAMEDIR$ etc).
 - Added SendEvent() function that allows to trigger "on_event" function calls in script.
   Special event value eEventUserEvent may be used as a base index for user-defined events.
 - Added System.DisplayFPS property that toggles FPS counter (a replacement to Debug(4, 1)).
 - Added System.GetEngineInteger() and System.GetEngineString() for returning diagnostic
   information about engine's runtime state. Possible arguments are defined by
   EngineValueID enum.
 - Added new game-wide option OPT_SAVEGAMESCREENSHOTLAYER that lets to define which of the game's
   render layers will be captured when making a standard screenshot for the save game.
 - Add SaveComponentSelection enum and game option OPT_SAVECOMPONENTSIGNORE, which lets to skip
   certain components when saving or restoring a game. This has dual purpose: reduce number of
   things in game that may break older saves by simply not having them in a save, and also
   reducing the size of game saves on disk (e.g. in case of dynamic sprites). Note that all things
   that were not restored from the save will retain their *current state*.
 - Fixed some script functions in AGS API were declared with "int" return value, while they
   are supposed to be "void".

Engine:
 - Updated to SDL 2.30.11 and SDL_Sound 2.0.4.
 - Engine now potentially supports reading saves made in older game versions with different
   content, so long as these saves have *less* data in any given type (i.e. less Characters,
   or less controls on a certain GUI, or less variables in script, and so forth).
   This feature is enabled by having a special "validate_restored_save" function anywhere
   in the game script, that accepts an argument of type RestoredSaveInfo. RestoredSaveInfo
   contains various information about the restored save, and "Cancel" property, that must be
   explicitly set to "false" in script in order to allow to restore such save.
 - Engine supports returning to previously saved rooms which have less script data.
   It's important to remember though that it does no validation of restored room state on its own.
 - Dropped support for pre-3.5.0 game saves.
 - Increased the cap of simultaneously loaded scripts to 1024 (this includes all regular script
   modules, a single active dialog script, and a single active room script).
 - Engine no longer quits with error in case a script function assigned to a Room event is missing.
   Logs warnings about missing script functions assigned to any events.
 - Character.FollowCharacter() can now have a distance parameter up to 32766 (was limited to 255).
 - Ensure that Character.Speaking returns true when a speech is playing even if the character
   has no speech view.
 - Character.PlaceOnWalkableArea() now does a 1-pixel step scan, ensuring walkable area will be
   found regardless of how small it is. Optimized the search algorithm to keep it fast enough even
   in very large rooms.
 - Support voice-based lipsync (Pamela, Papagayo) with Lucas-Arts style speech.
 - DynamicSprite.CreateFromFile() may now load 1-bit and 4-bit bitmaps, converting to 8-bit.
 - Do not alter or clamp palette for 8-bit sprites loaded into a 16/32-bit game at runtime.
 - Assigning InventoryItem.Graphic will no longer reassign CursorGraphic too even if they were
   identical previously.
 - Calling DeleteSaveSlot() on a slot within 0-50 range will no longer secretly move a save with
   the topmost number (within the same range) to fill the emptied slot. If you still like to
   recreate this behavior, then use MoveSaveSlot() command.
 - Support calling StopDialog() inside any regular script and dialog script, and also while
   dialog options are displayed. That will schedule dialog's stop to be performed after current
   script finishes.
 - Removed arbitrary limit of 2k bytes for the result of String.Format().
 - Engine will no longer quit with error if any object is assigned a non-existing sprite, but
   continue, using a sprite 0 as a placeholder instead.
 - Ensure that the objects with identical z-order (baseline) always keep same relative sort order
   when being drawn (note: engine does not guarantee a predefined order, only a persistent one).
 - Implemented video buffering on a separate thread. Allow to drop late video frames.
 - When mouse is locked in window, confine its position to the game viewport; exclude black border.
 - Added "display" config option to "graphics" section. This is a 1-based display index, where
   0 means "use default display".
 - Added new accessibility config settings in "access" section: "speechskip", "textskip",
   "textreadspeed". These let player to override game's skipping style for character speech and
   text messages, and text reading speed parameter that controls speech timing.
 - Added "max_save" config option in "override" section: this lets to enforce an arbitrary number
   of saves displayed in a standard save/restore dialogs in game.
 - Added "--display" command-line argument that lets choose which display to open game window on.
 - Added "--no-plugins" command-line argument that denies loading any plugins;
   also added respective config option "noplugins" in "override" section.
 - Fixed Software renderer being unable to restore a windowed mode on certain monitors,
   when switching from a real fullscreen mode.
 - Fixed character may get stuck inside a non-walkable area after Character.WalkStraight().
 - Fixed character may rarely finish walking on a non-walkable pixel.
 - Fixed calling Character.StopMoving() after AddWaypoint() succeeded a regular Walk() call with
   eWalkableAreas parameter will wrongfully teleport the character to the nearest walkable area,
   even though AddWaypoint is supposed to ignore walkable areas.
 - Fixed a number of region or hotspot's "Stand on hotspot" events may unexpectedly run after a
   blocking character's walk, even if character is no longer standing on that region/hotspot.
 - Fixed Lucas-Arts style character speech displaying offscreen if character is standing below the
   bottom of a room viewport.
 - Fixed calling Dialog.Start() inside a dialog script would create a nested "dialog state",
   which could eventually lead to internal mistakes and program stack overflow. Dialog.Start()
   will now schedule a proper dialog topic switch, equivalent to "goto-dialog" command.
 - Fixed displaying room masks with Debug command in legacy "upscale" mode.
 - Fixed a potential lockup that may occur when the engine is run from the editor, and is told
   to stop at a breakpoint.
 - Fixed 48khz OGG clips may have extra silence added to them in the end, causing "hickups" when
   the sound playback is looped.

Engine Plugin API:
 - Updated few callback and function prototypes in order to make them 64-bit compatible
   (allow pass and receive pointers). This includes AGS_EngineOnEvent for AGSE_TRANSLATETEXT
   and render stage events, and CallGameScriptFunction which now lets pass a const char* argument.
 - Added IAGSEngine.CreateDynamicArray(), which lets plugins to create dynamic arrays.
 - Added IAGSEngine.GetDynamicArrayLength() and IAGSEngine.GetDynamicArraySize(), which tell
   the passed array object's number of elements, and total size in bytes respectively.
 - Added IAGSEngine.Log(), which lets plugins to print using engine's log system.

Compatibility:
 - Fixed loading of games made in AGS 2.55-56 which include plugins.
 - Fixed loading of rare games made with AGS 2.5 or higher, which contained deprecated
   "room animations" (animations themselves are currently not functional).
 - Fixed old rooms with rare x3 resolution not displaying correctly.
 - Fixed old pathfinder imprecision affecting few pre-3.0 games.
 - Allow pre-2.7 games to have RestartGame() command be followed and overridden by a NewRoom().
   This is necessary for some older games to be able to proceed.

Windows:
 - Windows version of AGS is now built with MSVS 2019 and higher.

WinSetup:
 - Redesigned winsetup into a tabbed dialog.
 - Added "Reset To Defaults" button that resets all options to values from the game's default
   config file.
 - Added "Display" selection, allows to select which display to open the game window on.
 - Added "Accessibility" settings for skipping speech and text messages, for text reading speed.
 - In "disabled" section of config "access_skipstyle" setting lets disable all options in setup
   related to the speech and text skipping.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 11, May 2025

Editor:
 - Clear output panels when loading a different project.

Engine:
 - Fixed engine could run scheduled previous room's event after changing to a different room.
   This could happen, for example, if the room was changed in "on_event" with
   eEventEnterRoomAfterFadein; in such case a previously scheduled "After Fade-in" would run
   before proper "Before Fade-in" of the new room.
 - Fixed in 8-bit games Fade effect did not having a frame delay (was passing instantly).

Compatibility:
 - Fixed certain old 8-bit games (like "Trilby's Notes") did not recover after the FadeOut()
   script command.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 10, April 2025

Editor:
 - Fixed a check for an imported room mask size did not correctly account for the room's
   mask resolution setting (it worked, but mishandled some edge cases).
 - Fixed exceptions occuring when reimporting a sprite or a audio clip from source,
   if the source filename string was wrapped in double quotes.
 - Fixed script variables generation could sometimes produce a non-latin character in a
   variable name if the Editor is running on a system with non-English current locale.
 - Fixed '\n' linebreaks not saved correctly in dialog option strings.
 - Fixed translation compiler mistreating escaped opening bracket in a text line ("\[");
   it must keep it as-is, because "[" char is a old-style line break in AGS.
 - Fixed LogPanel not applying filter settings right after they were changed.

Engine:
 - Fixed a AudioChannel did not report a correct Position right after a AudioClip.PlayFrom() call.
 - Fixed Button resizing to sprite 0 size if NormalGraphic is set to 0 (default button look).
 - Fixed that if Character's walking speed is changed while its walking, and movement path contains
   45-degrees diagonal segments, character starts walking along a different route.
 - Fixed a solid Character (serving an obstacle) can get ignored by a walking Character, if the
   obstacle character's position appears within the walking character's own blocking zone.
   (This seems to be a redundant condition introduced very long time ago in the engine by mistake.)
 - Fixed object's look not updated after it was assigned a dynamic sprite, redrawn, sprite deleted,
   object redrawn without a sprite (used a placeholder), and then another dynamic sprite assigned
   with coincidentally the same number.
 - Fixed font outline index limited to 127 (although we theoretically support higher font numbers).
 - Fixed font outline parameters not initialized correctly if engine is built by a system that
   treats "char" as unsigned 8-bit type.
 - Fixed a crash which occured when script mistakenly tried to call RunInteraction() for
   a inventory item 0.
 - Fixed loading translation entries larger than 1024 bytes.
 - Fixed SDL log level was defaulting to "verbose" if not read from config (should be "info").

WinSetup:
 - Fixed "Save and Run" command sometimes caused 2 engine processes, one of which terminated later.
   This did not prevent a game from running, but could result in temporary CPU and memory overload.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 9, January 2025

Editor:
 - Fixed dragging an item to a folder in Project Explorer might cause that item to visibly appear
   in a wrong folder, if there are folders which name differ only in letter case.

Engine:
 - Fixed Character.Animate() could cause game to error reporting "invalid loop" if this character
   was idling at the time, and Character.LockView() was not called prior to Animate().
 - Fixed inventory cursor hotspot (crosshair) not drawn properly over item sprites with alpha.

OSX:
 - Fixed location of global config file: was in game installation directory, now in
   "Library/Application Support/uk.co.adventuregamestudio".


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 8, November 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed game cannot be loaded if its GameFileName setting is an empty string.
 - Fixed pressing Alt was not selecting Main Menu.
 - Fixed error occuring when trying to assign an image to the multiple selected View Frames
   if they have different initial images.
 - Fixed script preprocessor directive "#else" in the nested conditions. 

Engine:
 - Made File.ReadStringBack() support reading back strings without null-terminator in the end
   (ReadStringBack() reads a string, which has its length prepended to the sequence of chars).
 - Improved graphic mode selection when game window is moved to a secondary monitor.
   Note that still not all graphic setups are reliable on secondary monitors, specifically "real
   fullscreen" mode may be behaving unexpectedly if you try to switch to it on non-primary display.
 - Fixed AudioChannel's Paused state is not saved when saving the game.
 - Fixed error in case a character was walking while being locked to a temporary View, and switched
   to a directional loop which does not exist in the locked view.
 - Fixed active item cursor's image may duplicate itself onto other cursors under certain
   conditions.
 - Fixed Inventory Window in automatic mode not redrawing its contents immediately when player
   character changes.
 - Fixed ListBox.FillDirList() may add case-sensitive duplicates on platforms with case-sensitive
   filesystems.
 - Fixed room's fade-out effect playing while skipping a cutscene (it must skip instantly).
 - Fixed FadeOut or FadeIn not toggling screen state if they are inside a skipped cutscene.
   This could have resulted in screen not turning to black or not restored as expected if cutscene
   was skipped by player.
 - Fixed Wait() delay of value > 32k would be treated as infinite timeout.
 - Fixed Ctrl + Alt key combination not working (toggle mouse lock). This is a regression in 3.6.1.
 - Fixed game may fail loading on platforms with strict memory alignment (e.g. MIPS processors).

Compatibility:
 - Fixed SetCharacterViewEx() not treating "align" parameter according to old-style set of values.
 - Fixed SetTextOverlay() could cause internal mistakes leading to unexpected errors in game.
 - Fixed Wait() calls for pre-3.6.0 versions of Script API, where negative delay was treated as 0.

WinSetup:
 - Fixed setup not distinguishing "desktop resolution" and "native resolution" from explicit
   resolution sizes when saving or loading config. Made sure that it remembers exactly the choice
   that user made ("desktop", "game resolution" or explicit resolution size).
 - Fixed "native game resolution" not present in the list if it equals desktop resolution.
 - Fixed nearest resolution selection in case config requested a resolution equal to the native
   game's resolution, but that resolution was not among the supported ones.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 7, September 2024

Engine:
 - Hotfix mouse cursor not being drawn sometimes after changing rooms (regression in 3.6.1 P6).


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 6, September 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V not working in GUI editor.
 - Fixed sprite export and copying a sprite to clipboard operations were always exporting
   a 32-bit image, regardless of the actual sprite's color depth.
 - Fixed "Recreate spritefile" command was unintentionally converting any sprite to 32-bit if its
   source was not found, and it was taking existing image from the old spritefile.

Engine:
 - Fixed Software renderer could crash the game under some circumstances when the sprite cache's
   limit is exceeded (this is a regression in 3.6.1).
 - Fixed text-based lipsync's frame delay calculation: the existing formula was causing the delay
   value to "jump" back and forth with the slightest difference of speech text length, resulting
   in the speech lines of close length to be played with the notably different animation speeds.
 - Fixed drawing a 32-bit sprites on a 8-bit surface (e.g. a room mask), it was done wrong and
   was causing a memory corruption too.
 - Fixed drawing a room's walkable mask in script could cause errors during character walking
   if used colors exceeded walkable area number limit.
 - Fixed walk-behinds not drawn over characters and objects anymore (regardless of their baselines)
   after walk-behind mask was changed using drawing operations in script.
 - Fixed Game.SimulateKeyPress() not working in "old key-handling mode" (regression since 3.6.0).
 - Fixed script location is not reported in case of logical errors in engine's functions
   (regression since 3.6.0).

WinSetup:
 - Removed an obscure "Use 85 Hz display" option.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 5, August 2024

Editor:
 - When the room background size changes, clamp Room Edges to the new size.
 - Fixed Editor refusing to load a project if its folder name exceeds 40 characters.
   (An obsolete historical limitation which we forgot to cut from the program.)

Compiler:
 - Fixed script compilation hanging forever if a non-latin unicode character is met in script
   (outside of comments).

Engine:
 - Fixed GUI.ProcessClick() using mouse position when detecting a GUI control, instead of
   the position passed in the argument list.
 - Fixed Region.GetAtScreenXY() was returning null for offscreen coordinates. Made it return
   region[0] for consistency with other room areas, and backwards compatibility.
 - Fixed room Overlays not sorted in the order of their creation, like screen Overlays.
 - Fixed a potential mistake in Lucas-Arts speech position when there are multiple room
   viewports and speaking character is not directly visible in any of them.
 - Fixed Engine could switch program's locale to the current system locale by mistake
   when player is typing text. This could potentially lead to random glitches in text input
   in games which are run in ASCII mode and are handling extended characters.
 - Fixed TextBox was trying to display unsupported characters (in ASCII mode), resulting in
   random garbage.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 4, July 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed extracting templates with very large files inside would cause "Out of memory" error.
 - Fixed crash occuring when trying to import a non-existant GIF frame during Sprite Import.
 - Fixed potential mistake with sprite transparency occuring when importing a 8-bit sprite
   into 16/32-bit game.

Compiler:
 - Fixed "\t" (and few other less common escaped chars) not handled properly when they are
   inside string literals.
 - Fixed a crash in compiler occuring if user script defined a variadic function.
   (User-defined variadic functions are not properly usable at the moment, but this at least
   prevents an unhandled exception.)

Scripting:
 - Declare "UNICODE" macro for scripts if game is made in unicode mode.

Script API:
 - Added a number of missing OPT_* constants used with Get/SetGameOption functions.

Engine:
 - Fixed setting Screen.AutoSizeViewportOnRoomLoad to false in "game_start" could cause primary
   viewport and camera become initialized with zero width and height.
 - Fixed setting camera's size in "game_start" would unexpectedly get camera clamped to 320x200.
 - Fixed number of mistakes in Text Parser occuring when handling "multiwords".


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 3, June 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed that after deleting a View's frame editor did not select next frame (regression in 3.6.1).
 - Fixed "Delete last loop" button not appearing in the View Editor if the view is filled using
   "Assign sprites to view" command from the Sprite Manager.

Engine:
 - Implemented an alternate solution for rendering "bad" TTF fonts that does not increase their
   loading times (after previous patch 2).
 - Allow scene render during "load room" event if the last room transition was "Instant".
   This has to be done because number of games used this event for custom transitions.
 - For games compiled in "Debug" mode "warnings.log" file will be written in "savegame dir"
   on platforms where modifying game directory is forbidden in principle (OSX, iOS, Android, Web).
 - Fixed System.Log() was registered for plugins using a wrong argument list.

Compatibility:
 - Fixed loading of 3.5.0 saves (broken in 3.6.1).

Windows:
 - Fixed disk space check was testing space in the current directory instead of the
   save game location.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 2, May 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed few potential program errors for "Generate Keystore" in Android preferences.
 - Fixed external processes (such as test game runs) were started using ShellExecute,
   which could theoretically lead to unintended results.

Engine:
 - Fixed String.Replace crashing the engine if the resulting string exceeds 3000 bytes.
 - Fixed releasing a mouse button could cause double "on_event" call (with eEventGUIMouseUp).
 - Improved rendering of TTF fonts which have glyph sizes surpassing declared font's height.
   This fixes the look of text on gui controls, and automatic outlining on these fonts.
 - Fixed a dialog shown with InputBox() function drawing typed text beyond text box'es border.
 - Fixed custom dialog options in the "old mode" not triggering redraw when the active
   option changes.


VERSION 3.6.1 - Patch 1, April 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed View's frame preview sometimes drawn incorrectly, in case of certain panel sizes.
 - Fixed folding in the script editor not working correctly if there's a commented closing
   bracket ("//}") inside this code section.
 - Fixed Editor sometimes failing to update game exe's file information and/or icons, if
   user was importing any sprites during this working session.

Engine:
 - Fixed room objects not updating under Direct3D/OpenGL renderer, if they were assigned a dynamic
   sprite, then that sprite was deleted, and a new one assigned with coincidentally same ID.
 - Fixed room objects not updating under Software renderer, if they were assigned a dynamic sprite,
   and that sprite was modified while object was not visible on screen.
 - Fixed inventory cursor's crosshair not displayed (when enabled in game settings).


VERSION 3.6.1, April 2024

Common features:
 - Implemented Deflate compression option for sprites.
 - Removed length limits for: Game name, savegame folder, Character's script name and
   regular name (description), Inventory item's name (description), Mouse cursor's script name,
   Audioclip's script name.

Editor:
 - Discontinued Source control integration functionality, removed "Put sound and sprite files
   in source control" option from General Settings.
 - In General Settings moved few properties to different groups for better consistency.
 - Added "Scale Character sprite offsets" property to General Settings. This property refers to
   scaling of Character.z and sprite offsets added by LockViewOffset script command.
 - Added TextureCacheSize and SoundCacheSize properties to Default Setup. These let configure
   the sizes of runtime texture and sound cache sizes respectively.
 - Added "Leave room after fade-out" event to Rooms (called "Unload" by default).
 - Added Translated property to all GUI Controls (was available only in ListBox). Translated
   property tells whether this control's text has to be translated, and applied text direction
   (in right-to-left text mode).
 - Support '\n' linebreak character in the Label's Text and potentially other text properties.
 - Improved Room Editor controls:
   Added free panning mode done by holding the middle mouse button, or alternatively -
   by holding Space + LMB.
   Mouse Wheel without key modifiers scrolls the room vertically; Shift + Mouse Wheel scrolls
   the room horizontally.
   Zoom is done by Ctrl + Mouse Wheel and room now zooms towards or outwards the cursor position.
 - In Room Editor the context menu is now displayed by RMB or Shift + RMB while editing masks.
   The individual room mode menu is merged with the "copy coordinates" command when shown.
 - In Room Editor the hint with coordinates is now also displayed when moving Objects or Characters
   with keyboard.
 - In Dialog Script editor support most Edit menu and context menu commands from the regular Script
   editor, with a few exceptions.
 - In Sprite Manager added command "View" -> "Show filenames" which toggles display of a sprite's
   source filename under the sprites.
 - Adjust sprites' import settings after "Crop sprite edges" command; this would ensure that these
   sprites are restored from source file keeping their cropped sizes.
 - During sprite export Editor will display a proper progress dialog.
 - Zoom controls in Character and View panes now allow downscaling too. View editor displays the
   preview sprite stretched to fill the parent panel.
 - View editor now allows to select multiple frames at once, across multiple loops too, using
   standard Shift + LMB and Ctrl + LMB combinations. Properties panel lets modify properties for
   all the selected frames at once.
 - Added "Replace with all sprites from folder" command to the View editor's context menu.
 - For Audio Clips in the project tree added "Force Reimport", "Force reimport all file(s)" and
   "Replace Source File" context menu commands.
 - For Output Panel added "Copy selection" context menu command.
 - Implemented Log Panel that lets you see the engine and game logs right in the Editor.
 - Improved LipSync panel looks in case user's system has display scaling option enabled.
 - "Goto Definition" command in script will now work for most of the game entities too, such as
   Characters, GUIs, and so forth. In that case it will find a game's entity and open a respective
   editor panel for it. This still does not work for some types, such as Room objects, and Views.
 - Added main menu commands for opening a Project folder and Compiled folder.
 - Added "Export Global Messages to script" menu command. This command is meant for upgraded
   pre-3.2 game projects, and will generate a script with a String array, moving global messages
   texts there.
 - For script's tabs added a context menu command for opening this script's location.
 - When run with "/compile" argument Editor will print all messages to the console (stdout),
   instead of displaying modal message windows.
 - For Android build target Editor now supports a directory to place plugins in.
 - When building a game for Android and Linux the Editor will now be more tolerant to missing
   plugins and only issue a warning instead of stopping with error.
 - Config will now be saved in UTF-8, letting to support setup program's title text in unicode.
 - For non-Windows build targets Editor will fix config containing Direct3D graphics driver
   option and set OpenGL instead.
 - For Color Themes: implemented character literal, braces match and braces error settings.
 - Made Editor be somewhat more tolerate to missing XML nodes in Game.agf, in many cases it will
   still let open a game.
 - When upgrading older game projects, Editor will insert a call to SetRestartPoint() in the end
   of the 'game_start' function in GlobalScript.asc. This is done to complement removal of an
   automatic restart point in the engine. This inserted command is safe to remove.
 - When upgrading pre-3.2 rooms with disabled SaveLoadEnabled property the Editor will reset
   this property and insert a comment with a warning into the corresponding room's script.
   This is done because this property is deprecated as is no longer accessible.
 - Fixed Editor refusing to open a game if one of the translation files is missing.
 - Fixed General Settings and Default Setup not working correctly right after importing
   a pre-3.* game project.
 - Fixed importing GIFs or 8-bit PNGs may lose transparent pixels if source images used
   other palette index than 0 for transparency.
 - Fixed Project Explorer's folders collapsing after certain user actions, such as dragging
   items or renaming things.
 - Fixed deleting collapsed "region" in script would sometimes lead to portion of the script
   undeleted but staying invisible.
 - (Possibly) Fixed a "Index out of range" exception in Script editor, related to the
   "script location" drop-down list, which could occur at random circumstances while
   working with the script, and any Color Theme is enabled.
 - Fixed Editor could miss some of the files when cleaning up old compiled files after the
   Game's Filename property is changed.

Scripting:
 - Support "#else" preprocessor directive.

Script API:
 - Implemented Room's "After fade-out" event.
 - Added eEventLeaveRoomAfterFadeout event for the global "on_event".
 - Added eEventGameSaved event which runs after game was saved.
 - Expanded interaction functions for Character, Object, InventoryItem, Hotspot and Region types:
   now they all receive respective object's pointer as a parameter, similar to GUI event functions,
   as well as a cursor mode this interaction was run with, if applicable.
 - Added Game.ResetDoOnceOnly(), which completely resets all DoOnceOnly instances.
 - Added Game.PrecacheSprite() and Game.PrecacheView(), which preload certain sprites and linked
   frame sounds into the engine's sprite cache memory.
 - Added ScriptName property to AudioClip, Character, Dialog, GUI, GUIObject, Hotspot,
   InventoryItem, Object.
 - Added static GetByName() function to AudioClip, Character, Dialog, GUI, GUIObject, Hotspot,
   InventoryItem, Object.
 - Added Object.AnimationVolume property, which works similar to Character.AnimationVolume.
 - Added static File.ResolvePath() and File.Path property.
 - Added support for a text formatting to a number of functions:
   DisplayAtY(), Character.SayAt(), Character.SayBackground(), DrawingSurface.DrawStringWrapped().

Engine:
 - Updated to SDL 2.28.5 and SDL_Sound 2.0.3+.
 - Significant performance improvement to scripts. Script running speed restored to a level
   close to AGS 3.2.1. Testing few "script-heavy" games showed fps raise by up to 30-40%
   compared with 3.6.0 engine.
 - Improved performance of String objects in script. For instance, appending a character to
   a String is now roughly x2 times faster, *sequential* iteration of String.Chars[] in Unicode
   mode is about x12 (!) times faster (Strings in ASCII mode have relatively less improvement,
   because they have been faster than Unicode mode already).
 - Improved performance when creating, deleting and manipulating Overlays; allows the game
   to have thousands of those with much less slowing down.
 - Improved performance when updating and deleting dynamic sprites, and notifying any objects
   that have to redraw themselves. Engine no longer resets Graphic properties of objects
   referencing deleted dynamic sprite to 0.
 - Implemented "texture cache", in addition to the existing "sprite cache". The texture cache
   keeps textures generated from raw sprites and lets reusing them, improving performance
   and reducing CPU workload. The actual impact is proportional to the game's resolution and
   amount of simultaneously animated objects on screen.
 - WFN font renderer now too supports unicode mode and renders texts in utf-8, so long as the
   font contains glyphs of corresponding indexes.
 - Buttons, ListBoxes and TextBoxes now support Right-to-left text direction.
 - DrawingSurface.DrawString now supports Right-to-left text direction.
 - All the script File functions now treat paths in case-insensitive way (including subdirs),
   which makes them platform-independent.
 - Removed an automatic SetRestartPoint() call at startup. This is done in case user does not want
   to use default "restart" save slot, or has a custom save system.
 - Support handling multiple mouse clicks per game frame, similar to how multiple key presses
   were supported since 3.6.0.
 - When starting up, engine will now precache only first 4 or 8 loops of the starting player
   character's View. This is done to avoid filling sprite cache with too much sprites at once
   in case when the player's View contains lots of additional animations.
 - Characters will now have their graphic offsets, set by Character.z property and LockViewOffset()
   function, scaled along with the character's own scaling. This is done so long as the respective
   game option is enabled in the General Settings.
 - Ensure that character and object scaling is updated even when the game is not drawn.
   This fixes rare issues when their scale property did not update in time whilst the game was
   completely fadeout, and similar cases.
 - Allow to change Character's move speed while its moving.
 - When Character is ordered a new move command while already moving, the engine will try to make
   a smooth transition between old and new moving without a delay.
 - Ensure that when Overlays have identical ZOrder they will be sorted in the order of their
   creation. Besides convenience, this is also meant to restore historical behavior from before
   Overlay.ZOrder property was introduced.
 - Allow game to call DynamicSprite.CreateFromDrawingSurface() and CreateFromBackground()
   with zero or negative size, clamping it to 1x1, in consistency with Create().
 - Engine will now log a warning for the most incorrect parameters to Animate function instead
   of quitting the game.
 - Engine will now skip blocking Character.Say commands instantly while skipping a cutscene.
 - Object.SetView now lets invalid loop and frame values, and fallbacks to using loop 0, frame 0,
   printing a warning. This is also consistent with backwards-compatble SetObjectFrame() behavior.
 - Changed Object.SetView() to not play a frame's sound, which could lead to a duplicated sound
   play if Object.Animate is run right after.
 - Text Overlays internal images are now registered as dynamic sprites, and their IDs may be
   read from Overlay.Graphic. This lets find out their sizes using Game.SpriteWidth/SpriteHeight
   and optionally draw them somewhere using DrawingSurface.DrawImage.
 - Ensure all the script API is now correctly available for the plugins.
 - Engine will now safeguard plugin's reading and writing of game saves, so that any mistakes
   done by plugins won't affect other parts of a save.
 - Engine will disable vsync in a "infinite fps" mode, because vsync prevents getting more fps.
 - Engine will force any in-game debug messages to be displayed as blocking message boxes,
   disregarding game's "Display all messages as speech" option.
 - Display critical alerts as system modal message dialogs on all platforms that support that
   (unless engine is run with "--no-message-box" parameter).
 - Print some info about memory usage when reporting a "Out of memory" error.
 - Deprecated in-game "console", as practically useless.
 - Added new config settings in "graphics" section: "sprite_cache_size" (which replaces deprecated
   "cachemax" in "misc") and "texture_cache_size".
 - Fixed Characters may be seemingly "walking in place" for some time when arriving at destination.
 - Fixed Display and Say commands treating the second met "&" sign as a voice-over token too
   (they must only check the first one in string).
 - Fixed PlayMP3File() function limiting filename argument by an arbitrary number of characters.
 - Fixed speechlines were adjusting their Y position while trying to not overlap GUIs even when
   these GUIs are completely offscreen.
 - Fixed first Sierra-style speechline in a sequence was adjusting its Y position without need
   when GUIs are set to be hidden during game pause (this includes blocking speech).
   Normally, the speechlines are adjusting their Y position in order to not overlap GUIs,
   but when GUIs are hiding during speech there should not be any need to do so.
 - Fixed script behavior in case a local variable was assigned a value without being initialized
   with a zero memory by compiler's intruction beforehand. This is not a problem with the standard
   compiler, but technically could be an issue with any custom implementation.
 - Fixed old-style letterbox viewport getting broken after loading an old pre-3.5.0 save.

Engine Plugin API:
 - Added IAGSStream interface, IAGSEngine.OpenFileStream() and GetFileStreamByHandle().
 - Added IAGSEngine.ResolveFilePath() method, which resolves a script path (with location tokens)
   into a proper system filepath.
 - Fixed IAGSEngine.GetFontType() incorrectly reporting TTF font type for WFN fonts with more than
   128 characters.

Compatibility:
 - In Editor, restored all the Character's variables available in "backward-compatible" mode.
   This is primarily to make it easier to import very old games.
 - Allow to run an animation over a loop with zero frames, by using the placeholder frame.
   This lets particular old games to continue running instead of crashing with error.
 - Fixed slower character walking speeds in pre-3.1 upscaled and high-resolution games.
 - Fixed Object.SetView() and SetObjectFrame() not treating -1 for loop and frame as
   "keep previous values" in older games.
 - Fixed inventory window not updated after game.top_inv_item is assigned a new value.
 - Fixed a "New Room" command in old-style dialog scripts was preventing "First time Enter room"
   event to be called.

Windows:
 - 32-bit Windows engine is now built as "large address aware" program, which will allow it to use
   up to 3 GB of RAM on 32-bit systems and 4 GB of RAM on 64-bit systems (was 2 GB previously).

iOS:
 - Updated port for 3.6.*.

Web / Emscripten:
 - Fixed Safari cannot switch the game into fullscreen mode.

WinSetup:
 - Added options for setting texture cache and sound cache size.
 - Added options to disable particular graphic drivers and graphic driver selection,
   and fullscreen mode selection.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 13, April 2025

Editor:
 - Fixed translation compiler mistreating escaped opening bracket in a text line ("\[");
   it must keep it as-is, because "[" char is a old-style line break in AGS.

Engine:
 - Fixed loading translation entries larger than 1024 bytes.

WinSetup:
 - Fixed "Save and Run" command sometimes caused 2 engine processes, one of which terminated later.
   This did not prevent a game from running, but could result in temporary CPU and memory overload.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 12, February 2025

Engine:
 - Fixed deleted DynamicSprite which is still assigned to a mouse cursor may cause engine's
   sprite cache to enter a corrupt state, eventually leading to a crash.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 11, April 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed exception in Room Messages editor occuring if a certain game's Character is missing.

Engine:
 - Fixed disabled GUIs not hiding their controls if "Hide all their controls" disabled style
   is set in General Settings, and game is run with Direct3D or OpenGL renderers.
 - Fixed "greyed out" GUI controls leaving traces on parent GUIs when running with Software
   renderer.
 - Fixed text parser in Dialog Options not working correctly if "new key handling" mode is on.
 - Fixed DynamicSprite.SaveToFile() return value was inverse (regression in 3.6.0).
 - Fixed engine crash in GetHotspotProperty() if the function is called with invalid ID.
 - Fixed room Camera may fail to restore its position in the room after loading a save.
 - Fixed fonts may not be assigned correct parameters when a new game is launched
   by calling RunAGSGame() in script (regression since 3.6.0 or 3.5.*).

Compatibility:
 - Fixed engine refusing to load saves made by 3.2.0 engine, although being capable to do so.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 10, February 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed a warning condition for copying 32-bit bitmaps to a desktop clipboard of less color depth.
 - Fixed keyboard shortcuts for GUI Editor's Copy and Paste commands.
 - Fixed a rare exception when scrolling the room in the editor.
 - Fixed "Auto-number speech lines" and "Create voice acting script" operations failing
   if a Character's name contains underscore.

Compiler:
 - Fixed escaped character literals not being parsed correctly. This makes character literals
   like '\n' and '\t' actually work in script.

Engine:
 - Updated SDL_Sound library to 2.0.3.
 - Improved OpenGL texture management, which should result in less system and video memory
   spent on sprite textures.
 - Fixed Character.AddWaypoint() potentially using wrong walkspeed, if multiple characters or
   objects are ordered to start a non-blocking move in a mixed order.
 - Fixed Character.AddWaypoint() is using incorrect speed if this room has a non 1:1 mask
   resolution, and "Scale speed with mask resolution" setting is enabled.
 - Fixed Overlay.Create() crashing the engine if a non-existing sprite is passed as an argument.
 - Fixed Say("...") command get stuck in endless loop if Speech.DisplayPostTimeMs is non-zero.
 - Fixed PlayFlic() not working if called second time in game.
   This is likely a regression since 3.6.0.
 - Fixed NumPad keys not handled properly by the engine (in on_key_press, IsKeyPressed, and TextBox
   control). This is a regression since 3.6.0.
 - Fixed OpenGL renderer causing scaled sprites to have colored outlines sometimes while using
   Linear filter.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 9, January 2024

Engine:
 - Fixed engine incorrectly reporting a script loading error, which may occur if the total size of
   script's global variables is bigger than the size of the compiled bytecode.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 8, January 2024

Editor:
 - Fixed command "Crop sprite edges" in the Sprite Manager would copy import settings from the
   completely unrelated sprite onto the cropped one.

Engine:
 - Fixed @GAMENAME@ label not updating if Game.Name property is changed at runtime.
 - Fixed System.ColorDepth was reporting a final display resolution, while it should report game's
   native resolution for historical reasons.

Compatibility:
 - Fixed "upscale" mode not working for "default" game resolution in pre-3.1 games (the hidden
   meaning of "default" is 320x200 also).

Windows:
 - Fixed a rare bug when the Windows engine could fail loading the game for no good reason.
   This error is related to a bug in Windows SDK 8.1.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 7, December 2023

Editor:
 - For Android build target disabled compression of `.ags` and `.vox` assets, as that slows down
   engine streaming resources (sprites etc).
 - Fixed Editor failing to start if user preferences file is corrupted
   (this is a second fix, complementing one done in AGS 3.5.1).
 - Fixed RAM use spiking fast during batch sprite reimport from sources, which could randomly
   lead to program errors.
 - Fixed Dialog properties displaying internal values not meant to be seen by a user.
 - Fixed selecting parent GUI after its control did not display GUI's own properties in
   the Properties Grid.
 - Fixed Editor generating deprecated settings in the default config file.

Engine:
 - Fixed GUI controls unexpectedly clipping parts of text even if "controls clip contents"
   setting is disabled, in case when their Font has VerticalOffset property set.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 6, November 2023

Editor:
 - Fixed GUI editor could display selection rectangle from a different GUI editor pane,
   if two or more are displayed on screen at the same time.
 - Fixed "autoptr" and "builtin" keywords not colored as valid keywords in the script editor.
 - Fixed character literals in a script editor having wrong colors when a Color Theme is applied.

Engine:
 - Made String.Chars and Length properties work faster in ASCII mode.
 - Issue a warning when blocking Display or Say commands are called during fade-out.
 - Fixed engine failing to startup sometimes if controller device subsystem failed to init
   (it should not init at all in this version, as we do not support joysticks yet).
 - Fixed "Before fade-in" event could be called recursively under some peculiar conditions
   (regression since 3.6.0).
 - Fixed buttons on a non-clickable GUI were still changing to "mouse over" graphic under cursor.
 - Fixed button click not registered if it has been made not visible and visible again during a
   single game frame (regression since 3.6.0).
 - Fixed TextWindow borders drawn behind the rightmost corner pieces, which may be seen if the
   edge sprites are half-transparent.
 - Fixed a brief black screen flash occuring right after the video playback ends
   (regression since 3.6.0).
 - Fixed engine refusing to load legacy saves if the audio clip count does not match
   (number of audio clips should not affect saves).

WinSetup:
 - Added an option to disable "smooth scaled sprites" setting.
 - Added an option to disable language selection.
 - Made filter names in "disabled" section treated in case insensitive way.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 5, September 2023

Editor:
 - Reimplemented multiple sprites properties editing in the Sprite Manager. This ability was
   dropped in 3.5.0 unintentionally.
 - Fixed Autocomplete not treating certain struct members as "static" or "protected" if their
   declaration is too long.

Engine:
 - Fixed Character.WalkStraight() was resetting walking animation if called during walking.
 - Fixed Character's idle animation getting reset to frame 0 when the speech is played without
   a valid speech view (idle animation should continue playing in such case).
 - Fixed idle animation sometimes not starting immediately after Character finishes walking.
 - Fixed a crash occuring if script tries to get or set a custom property for a non-existing
   Room Object (this seem possible to do by iterating over `object[]` array).

Compatibility:
 - Implemented "legacysave_assume_dataver" override option in config, which lets to instruct the
   engine which game data version to assume when restoring legacy (pre-3.5.0) saves. This "hack"
   appeared to be necessary because of a mistake done during development of the older engine
   versions, where the save format was changed, but engine was made to rely on the game data
   version instead of incrementing save format index.
 - Implemented "legacysave_let_gui_diff" override option in config, which lets the engine to
   read less gui elements from restored save than the number registered by the game.
   This is to emulate a (possibly unintended) effect in pre-3.5.0 saves.
 - Fixed engine could try to load game data from game.exe without checking whether data is actually
   appended to it when restoring a legacy save in a game with a different file structure.
 - Fixed number of GUI elements were not tested when loading a legacy save, which could lead to
   GUI data getting overwritten incorrectly without a warning if number of controls changed since.
   If the test failed, engine will act according to "legacysave_let_gui_diff" config option:
   either quit with error or log a warning and continue.

Plugins:
 - Fixed potential "index out of bounds" exceptions in the built-in PalRender plugin.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 4, August 2023

Editor:
 - Export Game's Title into translations.
 - Fixed Game.agf was not created after importing a 2.* game project (regression in 3.6.0).

Engine:
 - Character.AnimationVolume property is now applied to the portrait animation as well.
 - Removed few of the less important game messages from logging, because they may quickly clutter
   the log under some circumstances.
 - Fixed when animating a character portrait, the first frame's linked sound is not played.
 - Fixed IsSpeechVoxAvailable() returning positive result if run from IDE and Speech folder
   is empty.
 - Fixed speech and messages were skipped by modifiers and other special keys (Ctrl, Alt, etc).
 - Fixed crash occuring when you resize DynamicSprite while it is displayed on screen.
 - Fixed audio clip started right before a ChangeRoom would not play until after the room changes.
 - Fixed in Software display mode the room Overlays may not be properly covered by a walk-behind
   under very specific conditions.
 - Fixed System.Log() would cause engine crash if there are more format placeholders than args.
 - Fixed some game options that are not allowed to be changed at runtime could still be
   overwritten when restoring an old save, leading to a weird game behavior.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 3, July 2023

Editor:
 - Don't error when loading a room file which has unsupported number of events,
   instead these will be cut out. This may let e.g. use room templates from newer
   versions of AGS.
 - Sprite's default property is changed from deprecated Resolution setting to SourceFile.
 - Fixed full spritefile recreation would write duplicate sprites into the spritefile,
   if game project (Game.agf file) contained multiple sprites with same ID for any reason
   (for example, if they were added by manually editing Game.agf).
 - Fixed importing SCI fonts with >128 chars.
 - Fixed font preview did not properly display characters with indexes 128-255.

Engine:
 - Fixed "noloopcheck" script function modifier was not handled correctly sometimes.
 - Fixed a button with inventory placeholder did not update immediately when the active
   inventory is set.
 - Fixed textual GUIs were not redrawn immediately after a call to SetGameOption(OPT_RIGHTTOLEFT).


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 2, June 2023

Common:
 - Fixed a TTF font could cause a crash in the Editor or the Engine if the font renderer tries
   to draw a letter with higher number than the highest glyph number in the font.

Editor:
 - Added "Restore all sprites..." command to the Sprite Manager's context menu
   (this duplicates the "File -> Recreate sprite file" menu command added previously).
 - Refresh Sprite Manager after fully recreating a sprite file.
 - Sprites will now hide their "Resolution" property if the game settings have "Allow relative
   asset resolutions" disabled. This is to avoid user's misuse of this property.
 - Fixed a minor memory leak occuring when editing a tree item's label in Project Explorer.

Engine:
 - Engine will now find and load plugins in the game dir when run from a different location.
 - Fixed crash occuring if Character was told to FaceLocation while "Turn to face" game
   setting is enabled, and character's View does not have enough loops.
 - Fixed Character resetting current non-blocking animation if it was ordered to Move,
   as soon as it arrives at destination.
 - Fixed crash occuring if a GUI button was somehow set a negative NormalImage number.
 - Fixed "bad script stack" error could be sometimes displayed if the game was aborted in
   the middle of running a script.


VERSION 3.6.0 - Patch 1, May 2023

Editor:
 - Fixed room's deprecated setting LegacyMusicVolumeAdjustment not applied correctly.

Engine:
 - Fixed Room Objects whose dynamic sprite was deleted in "leave room" event becoming
   invisible during fade-out transition. Logically this has to happen, but historically
   they kept displaying until the transition end, so we restored this behavior for compatibility,
   and simply because there's no "after fade-out" event in the engine yet to delete these sprites.
 - Fixed Game.StopAudio() fails to remove queued clips if no particular audio type id is requested.
 - Fixed performance regression in the script related to long loops (regression in 3.6.0).
 - Fixed memory leak occuring when printing text in Right-to-left mode (regression in 3.6.0).
 - Fixed rare mistake during text wrapping which may occur if a Unicode text is cut in the middle
   of the word.
 - Fixed playing certain WAVs caused game to freeze forever on exit.

Compatibility:
 - Fixed frame-linked sounds not playing in the games made before 3.6.0. 
 - Allow game to call DynamicSprite.Create() with negative size, clamping it to 1x1.


VERSION 3.6.0, April 2023

Common features:
 - Full Unicode support for all game texts: game properties, scripts, translations, input.
   ASCII/ANSI mode is still working, for backwards compatibility. This may be configured
   in the game project.
 - Extended sprite compression options: lossless storage optimization for 16- and 32-bit
   sprites; LZW compression option for sprites in addition to existing RLE compression.
 - GUI controls may now be told to clip their contents, which means that nothing gets drawn outside
   of their borders (as defined by X, Y, Width, Height properties). The only exception is Sliders,
   which are more complicated.
 - The historical TTF fonts' "fixup" that altered their height and vertical offset is now
   optional and works only if backwards compatible option is set.
 - Max number of AudioChannels is now 16 (was 8).
 - Removed game Cursors hard limit (was 20).
 - Increased Room Objects limit to 256 (was 40).
 - Discontinued "Windows Game Explorer" support in both Editor and Engine.

Editor:
 - Editor requires .NET Framework 4.6 to run.
 - Added Android build target support (requires "Android component" installed).
 - Added Web/Emscripten build target support (requires "Web build component" installed).
 - Expanded UI color theme format, support global color options and allow missing entries.
 - Script editor works in unicode mode.
 - Added "Text format" option in General Settings which lets switching between ASCII/ANSI and
   Unicode (UTF-8) modes. This defines which format the game texts will be written in, when
   saving the game project and compiling the game.
 - Added "Use old-style keyboard handling" option to the General Settings, which lets select
   between classic key press handling and new one meant for unicode chars support in scripts.
 - Supports compiling UTF-8 translations. TRS file now has "Encoding" setting that tells
   how to interpret this TRS text.
 - Added support for building multiple speech voxes, by taking files from the Speech subfolders.
 - Added support for adding custom files into the game package. This is done by assigning
   a list of directories to "Package custom data folder" option in General Settings.
 - Editor now copies a acsetup.cfg file from the project's root folder (if one is provided by)
   as a base for generating default config file. Settings from Default Setup will be written over,
   but other found options won't be removed.
 - Added "Sprite file compression" option in General Settings, replacing "Compress the sprite file"
   option. The new option allows a selection of compression algorithm used for sprites. Currently
   supported: None, RLE (old default compression) and LZW.
 - Added "Enable sprite storage optimization" option to the General Settings, that permits the
   editor to repack sprites in a different storage format, reducing their disk size whenever
   possible. This option may be used alongside with the sprite compression. Note that this does not
   change how the sprites work in game.
 - Added "GUI controls clip their contents" option to the General Settings.
 - Added "TTF fonts height used in the game logic" option to the General Settings, that makes
   your game use real font's pixel height when arranging text and text-based UI elements,
   as opposed to the nominal font's size.
 - Added "Touch to Mouse Emulation", "Touch to Mouse motion mode" and "Display FPS on Screen" to
   Default Setup. Removed few deprecated options.
 - Added "TTF font adjustment" property to Fonts, as well as to General Settings where it serves
   as a project default for the new fonts. This property lets you choose between "no changes" and
   backward compatible TTF fixup meant to keep fonts made for AGS displayed as they were meant to.
 - In the "Import TTF" dialog added a choice to import the size closest to the given pixel height.
 - Fonts now have Auto Outline Style and Auto Outline Thickness properties.
 - Fonts now have a readonly Family Name field, that lets user see the original name of a font
   they've imported (if available).
 - Added IdleDelay property to Characters that lets you set time needed to pass before IdleView
   is activated. This is equivalent to the Character.SetIdleView script function.
 - Added Character.IdleAnimationDelay property to let setup idle view's animation speed.
 - Added Cursor.AnimationDelay property to let setup cursor's animation speed.
 - The TextWindow edges now have distinct names in the dropdown list of the property grid.
 - Rooms created from a Blank template will now have default background of a game's resolution.
 - When creating new room objects they will now have their script names set to some default value.
 - Added Room.BackgroundAnimationEnabled property to let have disabled animation on room load.
 - Editor will now create an empty sprite file if one is missing in the game project. Any existing
   sprite descriptions in the project will be kept, letting user to reimport these from sources.
 - Added "File -> Restore all sprites from sources" menu command.
 - Added "Apply" button on editor's Preferences dialog.
 - In Preferences replaced "Import Color Theme" with a "Open Theme Folder", as a temporary solution
   for managing theme files.
 - Select script editor's font in the editor's Preferences.
 - Added "Help" option to the editor pane's tab context menu.
 - Upgraded script editor to Scintilla 3.21.1 and ScintillaNET 3.6.3.
 - Cursor's position in script is now displayed on the status bar.
 - Dialog scripts now too can open help topics for keywords or script functions under cursor on F1.
 - Added zoom controls for the Sprite Manager, Character, Cursor, Inventory and View panes.
 - Sprites may now be imported by drag'n'drop into the Sprite manager.
 - In sprite manager's context menu added command "Create source files for all sprites with missing
    / external sources..."
 - In sprite manager's context menu added (restored) command "Replace sprite using previous files".
   Also made "previous file" remembered consistently whenever a sprite is imported or replaced.
 - In sprite manager's "export all" dialog added "skip if inside project's folder" option.
 - In sprite manager's "export all" dialog added "reset tile settings" option.
 - On the View pane the frames having set delay and linked sound will be now indicated with icons.
 - Editor no longer errors and fails when opening a game project with some script files missing.
 - Editor no longer errors on empty translations when compiling the game.
 - Editor now exports values of the string type Custom Properties to translations.
 - Editor no longer prevents exporting string arguments from Get/SetTextProperty calls to TRS file.
 - Editor now cleanups spritefile on game load, identifying any data not referenced by the project
   and marking it for deletion.
 - Fixed editor silently enabling all available Build Targets when upgrading a pre-3.4.0 project.
   This could be very inconvenient as there are several of them supported now.
 - Fixed open folders in the Project Tree were collapsing whenever you create a new subfolder or
   change an object's name in properties.
 - Fixed editor was not preventing from entering Character's and AudioClip's ScriptName too long
   for the engine to handle.
 - Fixed Image and View properties in various objects were allowing negative values.
 - Fixed some of the object previews (at least GUI) could crash if user entered a non-existing
   sprite's number as an Image property.
 - Fixed editor displaying unhandled exception if the script which user is trying to open was
   missing. Instead it will now open a blank script.
 - Fixed room editor was suggesting to save the modified room even if no changes were made.
 - Fixed a recently imported sprite could be displayed incorrectly scaled up in the room editor
   for high-resolution games, if the "Allow relative asset resolutions" was enabled in General
   Settings, and the sprite 0 had "Resolution" property set to "Low".
 - Fixed program crash occuring on sprite's import if failed to open a source file for any reason.
 - Fixed View animation preview stopping at frame 100 (if loop contains over 100 frames).
 - Fixed going to a "find all" result in dialog script did not highlight the found text,
   and sometimes did not scroll down to it.
 - Fixed "Goto Definition" not working for Enums and Defines (macros).
 - Fixed script autocomplete sometimes was not updated right after opening a script.
 - Fixed script autocomplete for function calls was mistreating commas in strings and inline
   comments as if they were separating actual parameters.
 - Fixed script autocomplete was not displaying members of extended structs if the parent struct
   was declared in another header.
 - Fixed script autocomplete was not working for enum names.
 - Fixed structs and enums were not highlighted if declared inside a script's body.
 - Fixed in dialogs numbers inside names were incorrectly highlighted as numeric values.
 - Fixed matching or mismatching braces were not highlighted consistently at all times in
   regular and dialog scripts.
 - Fixed crash occuring when user was trying to set breakpoint on the very last line in script.
 - Fixed few editor panes were not opening correct help topics in F1.
 - (Possibly) fixed error message text in the runtime error popup could be drawn partially beyond
   the popup borders if the user's system has text scaling option enabled.

Compiler:
 - Support unicode character literals.
 - Support using float literals when defining default values for function arguments.
 - Support hexadecimal number literals (e.g. "0xABCDEF").
 - Removed 500-characters line limit.

Script API:
 - Expanded `on_key_press` callback, now supports two parameters: key code and key modifier flags.
 - In the new key handling mode `on_key_press` is called for each actual key press;
   e.g. combinations like Ctrl+Z will result in two `on_key_press` calls, one with eKeyCtrlLeft and
   second with eKeyZ; added support for "NEW_KEYINPUT_API" macro in scripts.
 - Implemented new `on_text_input(int ch)` callback which is called when the engine receives
   a printable character. This callback is essential for handling unicode chars in script.
 - Similarily, expanded `dialog_options_key_press` with the third `mod` argument, and implemented
   `dialog_options_text_input` callback for receiving unicode chars during the custom dialog
   options state.
 - Implemented `dialog_options_close` callback which is called when custom dialog options are
   removed from the screen. This allows to perform any required cleanup.
 - Added eEventEnterRoomAfterFadein event for `on_event` callback, which corresponds to
   "enter after fade-in" room event.
 - Added eKey constants for Shift, Control and Alt keys.
 - Added eKeyMod enum for key modifiers constants.
 - String.AppendChar(), ReplaceChar() functions and String.Chars[] property are now working with
   the unicode characters.
 - String.Format("%c") specifier will now be able to print unicode characters.
 - Extended Button.Animate() to have blocking style, direction and starting frame parameters, thus
   matching other Animate commands (of Character and Object).
 - Extended all Animate() commands by adding "volume" parameter, that defines volume of the
   frame-linked sounds for the duration of this animation.
 - Added Character.AnimationVolume, defining volume of the frame-linked sounds.
 - Added Character.IdleAnimationDelay to let control idle view's animation speed.
 - Character.Scaling is no longer limited by a range of 5-200 (now supports 1-32767).
 - Hotspot.Name and Object.Name may now be set in script.
 - Added Object.ManualScaling and Object.Scaling.
 - Deprecated Object.IgnoreScaling (use Object.ManualScaling instead).
 - Object.SetView default loop & frame values are now 0 (was -1 which retained loop and frame
   indexes from the previous view, often unexpected to the user).
 - DrawingSurface.DrawImage() and DrawSurface() now support optional source rect coordinates.
 - Added functions for getting DrawingSurface of room masks: GetDrawingSurfaceForWalkableArea(),
   GetDrawingSurfaceForWalkbehind(), Hotspot.GetDrawingSurface(), Region.GetDrawingSurface().
 - Added new delay parameter to Mouse.ChangeModeView() to let control cursor's animation speed.
 - Added Game.ChangeSpeechVox() and Game.SpeechVoxFilename, support switching the voice-over pack.
 - Added Mouse.AutoLock property that toggles automatic mouse lock inside the game window.
 - Added Room.Exists().
 - Added System.Log().
 - Added SkipWait() that skips any active Wait() function.
 - Added WaitMouse() to complement existing Wait functions.
 - Added InputType enum which defines input devices and lets create their sets as flags.
 - Added WaitInput(), a more generic and extendable function that accepts a combination of flags
   telling which input types to wait for.
 - All Wait* functions now may have infinite timeout if you pass a negative timeout parameter.
 - All Wait* functions now return the reason they were skipped: a combination of InputType flag
   and a respective key or button code.
 - Added GUIControl.Transparency property.
 - Added Overlay.CreateRoomGraphical and CreateRoomTextual. Use these two functions to create
   "room overlays": that is - overlays that display a sprite inside the room, sorted among other
   room objects, characters and walk-behinds.
 - Added readonly Overlay.InRoom property that tells if this is a room or screen overlay.
 - Extended Overlay.CreateGraphical() with a new "clone" parameter that tells whether to assign
   a sprite index, or make a sprite's copy owned exclusively by this overlay. The former will
   save program memory but make overlay update if the sprite is edited later. The latter is
   meant primarily for backwards compatibility. Overlay.CreateRoomGraphical has the same param.
 - Added Overlay.Graphic property that lets you change overlay's sprite after it's created.
 - Added Overlay.Width and Height properties, that let you freely scale existing Overlay.
 - Added readonly Overlay.GraphicWidth and GraphicHeight properties that let read original
   overlay's graphic size, as not all overlays hold a sprite reference (e.g. textual overlays).
 - Added Overlay.Transparency property.
 - Added Overlay.ZOrder property that lets you sort Overlays among themselves and other objects
   in the same "game layer": screen overlays are sorted among GUI, while room overlays are
   sorted among room objects, characters and walk-behinds.
 - Added Speech.TextOverlay and Speech.PortraitOverlay for accessing blocking speech overlay
   and portrait overlay respectively.
 - Added Game.BlockingWaitSkipped which tells the result of the last blocking wait skipping,
   also including result of the blocking speech skipping.
 - SkipSpeechStyle now supports eSkipNone mode; when used it will disable any kind of skipping,
   such speech can be only skipped by a direct command from script.
 - Extended Screen.ScreenToRoomPoint() with an optional "restrictToViewport" argument, which
   lets to choose whether tests over empty place result in conversion through the default
   viewport or a null pointer.
 - Added AudioClip.PlayOnChannel().
 - Added AudioChannel.Pause() and Resume() functions, and IsPaused property.
 - Added AudioChannel.SeekMs(), complementing PositionMs (as the Seek() function interprets
   position differently depending on the audio format).
 - PlayVideo() now supports an option to play both game's and video's audio track simultaneously.
 - Added File.WriteRawInt() to complement ReadRawInt().
 - File paths in script now support $DATA$ token, which tells to read files from the game package.
   This only works for read operations. Functions that support this token currently are:
   File.Open(), DynamicSprite.CreateFromFile(), ListBox.FillDirList().
 - Debug(2, 0) command that displayed walkable areas is superceded by Debug(2, n), where "n" is
   a mask type: 0 - none, 1 - hotspots, 2 - walkbehinds, 3 - walkable areas, 4 - regions. This
   command also works as a toggle switch, calling it with the same mask index will turn it off.
 - Debug(5, n) command that displayed character's walk paths now also works as a toggle switch.

Engine:
 - New SDL2-based backend for graphics, audio and input.
 - Hqx graphic filters discontinued (could be temporary).
 - Windows-only DirectMedia video playback discontinued (could be temporary).
   Only OGG/OGV videos are kept supported at this point.
 - Support resizing game window on desktop systems.
 - Support "borderless full-screen window" mode in addition to the real (exclusive) fullscreen.
 - Support for switching vertical sync at runtime with Direct3D/OpenGL renderers.
   Also enable vsync in windowed mode too.
 - Unicode (UTF-8) text support: engine can now switch between ASCII and UTF-8 text mode.
   This is controlled by both game's OPT_GAMETEXTENCODING setting and translation's "Encoding"
   setting: they tells whether to interpret game texts as UTF-8 or ASCII/ANSI.
 - Support optional translation's "GameEncoding" setting: it hints the original game's codepage
   to help with their conversion. This is mostly meant for translating existing older (ANSI) games.
 - Engine now supports using real pixel height of the TTF fonts when arranging text and UI elements
   on screen; using nominal import size of the font is used as a compatible mode for the old games.
 - Also supports separate "normal" and backward compatible "fixup" modes when initializing TTF
   fonts, letting to display both common TTFs and ones made specifically for AGS in the past
   to display as they were meant to be.
 - Supports scripts using functions and variables from any other scripts, regardless of the
   script module order in the project.
 - Removed limit of simultaneous Button animations.
 - Removed limit of Character followers.
 - Removed Overlay limit.
 - Character.SetWalkSpeed() is no longer restricted by an arbitrary limit of 50.
 - Process character's idle view based on real game speed, not hardcoded 40 fps.
 - Improved file writing times (e.g. when doing a game save) by using buffered file stream.
   Initial tests showed 50% faster file writing.
 - Engine now renders GUI controls as separate textures when using hardware accelerated renderers.
   This may significantly improve performance in the high-resolution games and games with large
   number of GUI elements on screen.
 - Engine now shares the video texture data for all game objects on screen sharing same sprite.
   This improves performance in case there are multiple objects which use same image.
 - Various performance optimizations for both raw drawing and texture updates (Direct3D/OpenGL).
 - Engine now ensures that in threaded audio mode the AudioChannel's state only changes once the
   game is updated, and not while the game script is running. This prevents situations when
   the clip could begin playing before all properties are set in script, or when AudioChannel's
   properties' values (such as Position) could change while running a game script.
 - 24-bit wav PCM support, comes with the new sound library.
 - File.ReadRawLineBack() now always reads full line, and not limited to 200 characters anymore.
 - Debug displays, such as showing room mask and character walk paths, are now implemented as
   non-blocking translucent overlays, allowing you to keep playing the game while they are on.
 - Implemented debug key controls for calling a built-in save and restore game dialogs. These
   controls have to be set in user config as "save_game_key" and "restore_game_key"
   in "[override]" category. These may be used by testers if the game is missing a save function
   or one is bugged.
 - Engine now supports loading compiled scripts as separate files packed along with the game,
   along with those embedded into the main game data or inside room files.
 - Engine no longer bails out with error if the chosen translation cannot be loaded on startup.
 - When reporting script errors, engine will print callstack for all the active script "threads":
   for example, if there's Wait() function called and error happened in repeatedly_execute_always,
   then it will print both actual error's location, and Wait() call's location.
 - Engine config now has graphic modes defined as a simplier string options:
   "[graphics] fullscreen" for the fullscreen mode setup, and "[graphics] window" for the windowed.
   Fullscreen option can explicitly define a "borderless full-screen window" mode.
 - Added "emul_mouse_mode" and "emul_mouse_relative" options to config in "[touch]" category.
 - Added "cache_size" and "stream_threshold" options to config in "[sound]" category, they setup
   the rules for sound caching and choosing whether to load a clip fully into mem or stream one.
 - Added "load_latest_save" and "show_fps" options to config in "[misc]" category.
 - Added "background" option to config in "[misc]" category, that defines the starting
   run-in-background (aka multitasking) mode (may later be changed by SetMultitaskingMode()).
   Added "--background" command line option for the same purpose.
 - Added "--sdl-log" command line option for setting up SDL2 library output verbosity. The engine
   log config now has a new "sdl" group meant for SDL2 messages.
 - Support "--user-conf-dir" command-line arg (and "user_conf_dir" config option) superceding
   "--localuserconf"; the new option directly tells the location of user config file.
 - Path related command-line and config options, - such as "shared_data_dir", "user_data_dir"
   and "user_conf_dir", now support $GAMENAME$ token in path which is resolved to the game's title.
 - Added "--clear-cache-on-room-change" command-line arg (and similar config option).
 - Don't error when DrawingSurface.DrawImage has bad transparency parameter (warning instead).
 - Don't error when detecting bad format in File.Read* functions (warning instead).
 - Added stubs for agsshell plugin (a contemporary cross-platform variant of ags_shell).
 - Added stubs for agsappopenurl plugin.
 - Fixed potential crashes if a room-related API function has been called in "game_start";
   this is achieved by having a dummy room placeholder object. Still results of such calls are
   undefined and should not be relied upon.
 - Fixed potential crash on room load if the walkable area mask contained color values
   above the supported range.
 - Fixed dialog script's "goto-previous" command not working if used from the first sub-topic run
   using "goto-dialog" (a very-very old bug).
 - Fixed AGS_EngineInitGfx plugin callback was not called during OpenGL renderer initialization.
 - Fixed Direct3D/OpenGL renderers were displaying plugin's raw drawings in a wrong position in
   the scrolling rooms, if the drawing was done on AGSE_PRESCREENDRAW or AGSE_POSTROOMDRAW events.
 - Fixed overlay may fail to be created sometimes, if previously another overlay had been
   forcefully removed when changing rooms (this is an ancient bug which existed for many years).
 - Fixed ListBox.RowCount reporting 0 if called before the control was displayed once.
 - Fixed GetTextWidth would still return a size of an outline for an empty text string.
 - Fixed text may be misaligned in gui controls, as its outline thickness is not counted.
 - Fixed some TTF fonts could be cut at the bottom when the speech is displayed.
 - Fixed scheduled sound fadeout effect was not cancelled by skipping a cutscene.
 - Fixed OGV Theora videos positioned incorrectly if they have certain sizes or aspect ratios.
 - Fixed game fps sped up if SetGameSpeed() is called repeatedly in game script.
 - Fixed game not reacting to system close commands when stuck in script, which made it impossible
   to close the "hanging" game by usual means (other than terminating the process).

Engine Plugin API:
 - Added IAGSEngine::GetGameInfo() function which returns information about the game, such as
   its title and GUID.
 - Added new render callback AGSE_POSTROOMDRAW, for handling drawing inside the room above all
   room objects.
 - Added IAGSFontRenderer2 interface, expanding the original font renderer interface, improving
   font plugins support.
 - Added ReplaceFontRenderer2() and NotifyFontUpdated() functions.

Compatibility:
 - Fallback to the first loop with frames if current character's loop does not have any.
 - Use the dummy frame if current character's speech view loop does not have any.
 - Ignore character having view/loop with no frames while it's not in the current room.
 - Legacy behavior of MoveCharacterBlocking's return value.
 - Fixed walkable area's continuous scaling was broken for high-res rooms in old games.
 - In pre-3.* games force player to walkable area after changing rooms, this is to emulate an
   unintentional effect created by the old engines.
 - Fixed pre-3.4.1 anti-aliased TTF fonts display (their vertical position was broken).
 - For pre-3.5.0 games support old behavior of coincidental dynamic sprite replacement
   on GUI backgrounds (and few other places) without explicit assignment; that is - when the new
   DynamicSprite is created right after deleting an old one.
 - Support Label.TextAlignment with legacy alignment constants for pre-3.5.0 games made with
   the custom engine from "Clifftop Games".
 - Support native resolution hack for games made with "Clifftop Games" custom engine, where
   640x400 games are run as 640x360.

Android:
 - Rewrote universal AGS game launcher/player using up-to-date Google guidelines. The former
   "launcher" is now called "AGS Player".
 - Implemented single game project template meant for building your own signed APK.
 - Implemented two touch-to-mouse control scheme (selectable in config), for one finger
   emulating LMB only, and for two fingers emulating LMB and RMB.
 - Support relative motion speed setting for touch-to-mouse emulation.
 - In AGS Player added "Browse" button to the game folder selection, which opens default system
   file picker.
 - AGS Player now searches for games recursively, in all the subfolders.
 - AGS Player now has preference button per each game, which opens individual game's settings.

OSX:
 - OpenGL renderer is now supported on MacOS.

Web / Emscripten:
 - Initial port release.

Windows:
 - Installer will create program links with three-digit version in the name.
 
Plugins:
 - Added SpriteFont plugin to the list of builtins, for ports that use ones.
   SpriteFont plugin is updated to support custom "Clifftop Games" font variants.

WinSetup:
 - Added "Fullscreen as borderless window" checkbox.
 - Remade sound options to reflect the move to the new audio system in the engine.


===================================================================================================

VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 20, March 2023

Engine:
 - Fixed AudioClip.Play allowing to place clips on a crossfade channel in general case;
   there's still a backward-compatible case where it's allowed to do so for audio types
   with reserved channels that exceed the normal channel limit.
   (Regression since 3.5.1 Patch 11)


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 19, March 2023

Engine:
 - Fixed System.Volume is not correctly applied after restoring the save.
   (Regression since at least 3.4.0)


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 18, February 2023

Engine:
 - Fixed background speech and textual overlays may disable GUI when being continuously
   created in repeatedly_execute* kind of functions. (Regression since previous patch)


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 17, January 2023

Editor:
 - Fixed GUI.Visible property was resetting to false when PopupStyle is switched to Modal.

Engine:
 - Performance improvement in Direct3D/OpenGL renderers, related to plugins which subscribe to
   render events.
 - Fixed renderer error occuring if room background frames are of different sizes.
 - Fixed software renderer may have an unpainted black line at the bottom, if there's a GUI or
   Overlay positioned partially offscreen.
 - Fixed GUI buttons could retain mouse-over pic after interface is disabled then enabled
   (this is a regression since recent patch).
 - Fixed crash occuring when user creates too many Overlays in script;
   will report a scripting error instead.
 - Fixed memory leak occuring when the TTF font is drawn partially outside the DrawingSurface.
 - Fixed Parser.Said() could lead to a program crash in case there are space-separated words
   following the comma (e.g. "climb,get in bed").
 - Fixed crash occuring if a plugin tried to call SetVirtualScreen().

Plugins:
 - Fixed SnowRain plugin drawing particles only in 320x200 bounds.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 16, December 2022

Editor:
 - Fixed autocomplete crashing the editor if there was an import declared with type and variable
   having identical names, and user tries to type that variable's name and a dot to access
   its members.
 - Fixed newly created Views taking free IDs in the middle of the list in random order instead of
   a straight one (after you previously deleted some Views).

Engine:
 - Added missing "DrawSprite" function for "agsblend" plugin stubs.
 - Fixed loading pre-3.5.0 games on big endian systems.
 - Fixed GUI buttons not displaying the mouse-over image if the interface state was toggled
   to enabled state while the mouse was over the button.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 15, October 2022

Editor:
 - Fixed crash that could occur when changing View's ID to an unused number in the middle.
 - Fixed comments and string literals were styled incorrectly in dialog scripts.
 - Fixed unterminated string literals in script were not considered as errors when processing
   scripts for translation update and autonumbering of speech lines, leading to wrong results.
 - Fixed Editor was updating translation file even if errors were found while scanning the
   scripts, which could cause a TRS corruption.
 - Fixed Editor could overwrite changes done manually to TRS while the editor is open and if
   you run a translation update right after.
 - Fixed potential program crash on exit in case an editor's plugin has mistakes in "shutdown"
   callback. Instead editor will report a component's error, but still close properly after.

Script API:
 - Removed a rule that Viewport and Camera with ID 0 can't be deleted.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 14, September 2022

Editor:
 - Do not error when compiling a 256 colors game if Direct3D or OpenGL are selected as a default
   graphics driver (display a warning instead).
 - Fixed crash when trying to import pre-2.60 game projects.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 13, August 2022

Engine:
 - Fixed room object does not update its texture if it had a dynamic sprite assigned to it,
   and that sprite was unassigned, modified or recreated with same ID, and then reassigned again, -
   all within the same game frame.
 - Fixed normal font renderer is not reinitialized correctly in the engine if a plugin uses
   IAGSEngine::ReplaceFontRenderer(), passing original renderer's pointer (which it received from
   the previous ReplaceFontRenderer call).


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 12, June 2022

Engine:
 - Fixed GUI textual controls don't redraw when the game translation changes until player clicks
   on GUI (regression since previous 3.5.1 updates).
 - Fixed multitasking mode persisting if the game was switched from windowed to fullscreen mode
   (even though it's not supposed to work in fullscreen).


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 11, May 2022

Editor:
 - Fixed batch sprite export with "Set exported file as sprite source" option was assigning
   new source paths without file extension.

Engine:
 - Performance fix: GUIs changing Transparency or Visible state should not redraw their surface.

Compatibility:
 - Allow AudioClip.Play to to place clips on a crossfade channel, which is normally unaccessible
   from script. This prevents errors in some games that relied on this behavior.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 10, April 2022

Engine:
 - Fixed crash when visible viewport does not have any linked camera.
 - Fixed ListBox.FillSaveGameList() may include save slots with negative slot number (e.g. when
   the save file has "*.-01" extension).
 - Fixed potential crash after failed RunAGSGame() call.
 - Fixed search for the game data by GUID when restoring a save belonging to another game;
   this was implemented in 3.5.1, but appeared to not work correctly.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 9, March 2022

Editor:
 - Removed restriction on max dialog topics in the project. The dialog limit in the engine was
   removed in 3.4.1, but remained in the Editor by oversight.
 - Fixed Audio Clip items in the project tree not displaying their IDs right after being renamed.

Compiler:
 - Fixed crash occuring when compiler tries to report "Already referenced name as import" error.

Engine:
 - Added "--translation" and "--no-translation" command-line arguments.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 8, Ferbuary 2022

Engine:
 - Clearer error messages for Get/SetProperty functions.
 - Fixed PlayFlic() command fails to start the video (regression in 3.5.1).
 - Fixed DrawingSurface.DrawSurface() not applying transparency parameter correctly if the
   drawn surface has alpha channel.
 - Fixed @OVERHOTSPOT@ is not updated immediately when character's name changes while cursor
   is above that character.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 7, January 2022

Editor:
 - Added "Layout -> Reset to Defaults" menu command.
 - Editor will now reset panel layout to default state if loading layout fail for any reason.
 - Default config is now saved also when the game is run in debug mode (F5). This ensures that
   the test run is using the latest Default Setup, if the user's config has not been created yet.
 - Editor will now display an error if user tried to reserve too many channels for audio types.
 - Fixed Editor failing to start if user preferences file is corrupted.
 - Fixed "Use old-style custom dialog options API" was not set when importing pre-3.4.0 projects.
 - Fixed comboboxes' drop-down arrows were not painted with the right color from a color theme.

Engine:
 - Fixed program crash occuring if the game reserved too many channels for audio types.
 - Fixed potential crash occuring when player loads a save made in a multi-frame room, but the room
   was since edited and no longer has as many frames.
 - Fixed character may have incorrect Frame property values while turning.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 6, December 2021

Editor:
 - Added line numbers in the dialog script editor.
 - Fixed Dialog script loosing changes if the pane is closed or redocked.
 - Fixed controls arrangement on the Dialog pane getting broken when it's redocked.

Engine:
 - Fixed filepaths in scripts that have backslashes ('\') fail on non-Windows systems.
   All the File functions will now convert backslashes in filepaths into forward
   slashes for compatibility.
 - Fixed engine was still creating standard directories for game saves and data, even
   if user provided the custom paths for these.
 - Fixed TextBox control crashing the game if it's empty and player presses Backspace.
 - Fixed controls on a fully transparent GUI were not interactive (this is an original
   AGS behavior, which was unintentionally changed in 3.5.0 by mistake).

Compatibility:
 - When running 3.5.0 games, treat fully transparent GUI as non-interactable.
   In AGS transparent GUIs may be still interacted with, but 3.5.0 introduced an
   unintentional (and undocumented) change to this, which was reverted in 3.5.1.

Android:
 - Support global engine's config file when the game is run from the Launcher: it's
   located in the AGS games' parent directory, same place where android.cfg is.

WinSetup:
 - Added "Custom game shared data path" to complement "Custom save path" option.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 5, October 2012

Re-released without code changes, only fixing program build instructions for Linux.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 4, September 2021

Editor:
 - Fixed swapping of inventory item's numeric ID could lead to errors.
 - Fixed crash when importing pre-3.* games with multiple script modules.
 - Renamed "Enforce object-based scripting" setting to "Enforce post-2.62 scripting".

Compiler:
 - Fixed potential memory corruption when user script reaches max nested if/else blocks.

Engine:
 - Also tell module name and approximate source line when reporting script import errors
   for the variables and local functions.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 3, August 2021

Editor:
 - Fixed sprite file over 2 GB could not be loaded (regression since the last patch).

Engine:
 - Further improvement to GUI performance: don't redraw GUI when the mouse cursor is
   hovering over or interacting with controls not leading to an actual visual change.
 - Fixed ListBox items could become unaccessible if its font or height is changed leading
   to a disabled scrollbar.


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 2, July 2021

Engine:
 - Fixed speech lipsync getting disabled after loading another game with RunAGSGame().
 - Fixed MOD/XM clips fail to play (regression).
 - Fixed certain OGV videos fail to play (regression).
 - Fixed software renderer was not updating game screen correctly when running a game with
   legacy "letterboxed" feature  (regression).


VERSION 3.5.1 - Patch 1, June 2021

Editor:
 - Fixed script compiler sometimes was not specifying actual Dialog number when reporting errors
   in the dialog scripts.

Engine:
 - Fixed Game.TranslationFilename always returning empty string (regression).
 - Fixed GUI controls which were toggled from disabled to enabled state not responding to the
   mouse clicks until the mouse is moved (regression).
 - Fixed OpenGL did not apply a Linear filter when "Render sprites in screen resolution"
   option is off.


VERSION 3.5.1, June 2021

Editor:
 - Added "Attach game data to exe" option to General Settings. This lets you to package game data
   separately from the game.exe (only important on Windows at the moment).
 - Deprecated "Limit display mode to 16-bit" property in Runtime Setup as it's no longer
   used by the engine.
 - Display aspect ratio in game resolution dialog.
 - Implemented classic Color Picker dialog for the Color type values in the property grid,
   instead of the default one which does not allow user-defined colors.
 - Improved tab switching performance for script windows.
 - Editor will now enforce full game rebuild after upgrading an older project, this ensures
   that all scripts are recompiled with the new version rules.
 - Fixed room lists in property editor were not updated after room number is changed.
 - Fixed importing pre-3.* projects broken by incorrect assignment of "Game file name" property.
 - Fixed importing Characters and GUI without sprites still created empty sprite folders.
 - Fixed crash when exporting/importing Characters with no Normal View.
 - Fixed translation compiler did not correctly save some of the escaped sequences, such as "\n".

Scripting:
 - Implemented correct parsing of a "const string" function return type.
 - Fixed implementing imported functions was forbidden in the room scripts.

Script API:
 - Added GUI.Shown readonly property that tells whether GUI is active on screen. This is primarily
   for GUIs with "Popup At Y" style, because they hide themselves regardless of Visible property.
   Note that since 3.5.0 GUI.Visible only tells a script-set value.
 - File.Open() now supports $CONFIGFILE$ tag which will try to open user config file for reading or
   writing regardless of where config is located on disk.
 - Added System.SaveConfigToFile() which writes current engine settings to the user config file.
   Only the options that can be changed at runtime are written back at the moment.
 - GetTranslation() now returns "const string" (was "string"). This is to prevent modifying
   returned string using old-style string functions, such as StrCat(), as this string may be
   allocated in the internal engine memory for its own use.

Engine:
 - Support loading audio and video from data packages larger than 2 GB.
 - Improved game data loading times by introducing buffered file stream. Initial tests
   showed 3-4 times faster file reading.
 - Improved game performance by not reupdating all of the GUIs each time anything changes, instead
   only affected GUI will be updated each time.
 - Some improvement to general script performance.
 - Some improvement to script Dictionary and Set types performance.
 - Room Object's Graphic property now can be assigned a sprite with index over 32767 and
   up to 65535. This restriction is due to internal data format, which cannot be fully fixed
   without breaking compatibility with plugin API. This may still be worked around by assigning
   a View, as View's frames may contain sprites of any index available.
 - Similarily, Object's View, Loop and Frame can now be assigned a value over 32767 and
   up to 65535; not that this was ever an issue...
 - Removed arbitrary limit of 1000000 dynamic array elements (now supports over 2 billion).
 - Dialogs with no enabled options left will be now stopped, instead of raising script error.
 - Engine will not longer quit the game when failing to write a save, but simply display an
   error on screen (...why this was a thing in the first place?!).
 - When restoring a save engine will now try to match game GUID pack rather than exe/pack name.
   This resolves potential problems when game package may have different name in distribution
   to another system. Also makes saves in multi-game collections more reliable.
 - In Debug game mode allow to toggle infinite FPS mode (prior it could not be turned off).
 - Expanded text parser error messages for easier debugging.
 - Adjusted all the command-line options to have consistent prefix convention, where all full-name
   options must be preceded by double-dash, and one-letter options by single dash.
 - Added "--localuserconf" command and similar global config option which tells engine to read and
   write user config in the game's directory rather than using standard platform path.
   Game dir must be writeable for this to work.
 - Added "--conf" command which forces engine to read only explicit config file on startup.
 - Added "--user-data-dir" and "--shared-data-dir" commands for setting save game directory and
   shared app data directory from command line (this corresponds to existing options in config).
 - Fully configurable log output (in both game config and command line) allows to set up which
   message types and groups are printed by which output methods (sinks), including: file,
   system console, in-game console. "warnings.log" is now created only if file log was not
   requested by user.
 - Added "--log-" set of command line options for setting up log output.
 - Added "--tell-filepath" option for printing known engine's and game's file locations.
 - Added "--tell-gameproperties" option for printing some of the game's general settings.
 - Support proper lookup for Allegro 4 library resources (such as its own config and digital MIDI
   patches) in the game directory.
 - Engine will no longer precreate directories for common files: saves, user config, and so forth,-
   before actually writing them.
 - Fixed running game from another directory by passing its relative filename as command-line
   argument: in this case engine was incorrectly using its own directory to search for external
   game data, opening files for reading by script command, and so on.
 - Fixed some of the engine's own hotkeys (such windowed/fullscreen mode toggle) not working
   during certain skippable game states.
 - Fixed overlay was set to wrong position if it were using TextWindow gui and either its text
   or X, Y properties got changed.
 - Fixed crash occuring when the speech is using text window gui with zero Padding and the speech
   text is an empty line.
 - Fixed characters and room objects were not updating their looks if their current graphic was
   a Dynamic Sprite, and that sprite was modified with ChangeCanvasSize, CopyTransparencyMask,
   Crop, Flip, Resize, Rotate or Tint function.
 - Fixed Views' frames keeping reference to deleted Dynamic Sprites.
 - Fixed engine crash when button's graphic is set to sprite out of range.
 - Fixed animated cursor's normal graphic reappearing in between animation frames if mouse mode
   is being repeatedly reassigned, for example in rep-exec script.
 - Fixed certain interactions did not work with GUI if it was made fully transparent.
 - Fixed ListBox.FillSaveGameList() search pattern, it included files which contain save filename
   pattern but do not exactly match; for example: "agssave.001_".
 - Fixed engine was ignoring audio files in game directory when running games which use
   old audio system.
 - Fixed crash in Direct3D and OpenGL renderers that occured if game uses a plugin that performs
   software drawing on screen, and one of the rooms is smaller than the game's resolution.
 - Fixed Direct3D was assigning wrong fullscreen refresh rate sometimes, slowing alt-tabbing.
 - Fixed "--test" mode was lost upon restoring a save.

Engine Plugin API:
 - Added IAGSEngine::GetRenderStageDesc() function which returns current render stage parameters.
   As of this version these parameters include 3 transformation matrixes, allowing any 3D render
   plugin to stay compliant to engine's scene rendering.

Compatibility:
 - Fixed engine was trying to read unnecessary data when loading pre-2.72 games.
 - Fixed "upscale" mode for old games (was broken in 3.5.0). Also engine will now try to detect
   if "upscale" mode wanted by reading old config options (if they are present).
 - Fixed GUI.Visible not returning expected values for GUIs with "Popup At Y" style in
   pre-3.5.0 games, breaking some older games logic.
 - Fixed potential buffer overflow when reading pre-3.1.0 games with old dialog script texts.
 - Fixed engine was applying player's position too early when ChangeRoom was called for 2.72 and
   earlier games, which could result in wrong placement in the new room if the character was
   walking right before the transition.

Android:
 - Corrected game scanning in AGS launcher, now it will work consistently with the desktop ports,
   and detect any compatible game data files named "*.ags" or "*.exe".

OSX:
 - When looking for game files engine will no longer use hardcoded filename, will search for any
   compatible pack file instead.

Windows:
 - Windows version of the engine now reads global configuration file. It is looked up in
   "%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/Adventure Game Studio/acsetup.cfg"
 - Default log file location is now also in "%USERPROFILE%/Saved Games/Adventure Game Studio".
 - Added "--no-message-box" command line option to hide message boxes when alerts are raised.
 - Added "--console-attach" command line option to try attach to the parent process's console.

WinSetup:
 - Fixed changing fullscreen mode from "use current desktop" to explicit resolution on save.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 3.5.0 - Patch 10, May 2021

Engine:
 - Fixed managed handle error that occured if you would copy an element of any string array
   returned by Dictionary.GetKeysAsArray(), GetValuesAsArray() and Set.GetItemsAsArray();
   for example: assign array's element to a local variable.

Editor:
 - Fixed importing Characters and GUIs saved by previous versions of the editor.
 - Added support for startup pane hyperlink color in Color Themes.

Engine:

 - Fixed Software renderer could freeze the game in case there are multiple room viewports.
 - Fixed Software renderer could draw room viewport in a wrong position if it was moved.
 - Fixed RunAGSGame crashed the game if it uses any font plugin (implementing IAGSFontRenderer).

Plugins:
 - Fixed built-in PalRender plugin had uninitialized variable that could cause a crash.


VERSION 3.5.0 - Patch 5, October 2020

Editor:
 - Fixed Inventory Item preview could show wrong sprites and/or sprites in wrong scale.

Engine:
 - Fixed Dictionary.Get() crashing on missing key instead of returning null, as expected.
 - Dictionary.GetKeysAsArray(), GetValuesAsArray() and Set.GetItemsAsArray() now return null
   if they have no elements (0-sized arrays are forbidden by AGS Script).
 - Fixed AudioChannel.SetRoomLocation() parameters lost upon restoring a saved game.

Linux:
 - Disabled mouse speed control as it cannot be correctly supported. This fixes mouse movement
   glitches in fullscreen on certain systems.

Compatibility:

VERSION 3.5.0 - Patch 3, July 2020

Editor:
 - In room editor adjusted the object selection bar's visual style, made dropdown buttons larger
   and easier to click on.
 - Made room editor display "locked" cursor consistently when whole object/area group is locked,
   and when over locked Edges.
 - Fixed room editor failing to initialize if currently selected object's name exceeded navigation
   bar's width.
 - Fixed some panels were not upscaling sprite previews in low-resolution projects as intended.
 - Fixed ViewFrame's default Sound value set as "-1 (unknown)" (should be "none").
 - Fixed "Change ID" command did not affect order of game objects in a compiled game until a
   project was reloaded in the editor.
 - Fixed "Change ID" command on a View restricted max ID to a wrong number (lower than normal).

 - Fixed Room editor displayed character incorrectly when its ID is changed.
 - Fixed import of room scripts when loading an old game made by AGS 2.72 or earlier.
 - Fixed another unhandled exception occuring when Editor was about to report "unexpected error".

Engine:
 - RunAGSGame() will now automatically reset translation to Default before starting new game,
   to prevent situations when new game will be trying to init a translation from previous game.
 - Character speech will be now displayed relative to the first found viewport the character is
   seen in, or the one which camera is closest to the character in the room.
 - Fixed crash when deleting custom Viewport in a non-software graphics mode.
 - Fixed Viewport.Camera not handling set null pointer properly (should disable viewport now).
 - Fixed Screen.RoomToScreenPoint()/ScreenToRoomPoint() functions were converting coordinates
   always through camera #0, instead of a camera actually linked to the primary viewport.
 - Fixed Screen.AutoSizeViewportOnRoomLoad property was forcing always camera #0 to align itself
   to the new room, instead of a camera actually linked to the primary viewport.
 - Fixed speech vertical position was not correctly calculated if the room camera is zoomed.

Linux:
 - Fixed script floats were printed according to system locale rules and not in uniform one.

Windows:
 - Again fixed game becoming minimized when quitting with error from the Direct3D fullscreen.


VERSION 3.5.0 - Patch 2, February 2020

Editor:
 - Fixed mouse cursor flicker above the script editor, again (was fixed first for 3.3.5, but
   then reverted by mistake).
 - Fixed bitmap palette was not remapped to game or room palette for 8-bit sprites if they were
   imported with "Leave as-is" transparency setting.
 - Fixed an imported palette did not really apply to sprites until reopening a game in the editor.

Engine:
 - Fixed crash when saving in a game which contains Set or Dictionary in script.
 - Fixed crash caused by a 32-bit sprite with alpha channel in a 8-bit game.
 - Fixed occasional regression (since 3.4.3) in OpenGL renderer that caused graphic
   artifacts at the borders of sprites, but only when nearest-neighbour filter is used.

 - Fixed keyboard and mouse not working when game is run under Wine (or, potentially, particular
   Windows setups too).
 - Fixed maximal allowed window size deduction, which works better on Windows 8 and higher.
 - Fixed game becoming minimized when quitting with error from the fullscreen mode, requiring
   player to switch back in order to read the error message.

WinSetup:

VERSION 3.5.0 - Patch 1, December 2019

Editor:
 - Fixed changing Audio Clip ID or deleting a clip could break sound links in view frames.
 - Fixed importing an older version project during the same editor session, in which one game was
   already opened, could assign previous game's GameFileName property to the next one.
 - Fixed some fonts may be not drawn on GUI preview after any font with lower ID was modified.
 - Fixed Pause and Stop buttons were enabled when first opening an audio clip preview, and clicking
   these could lead to a crash.
 - Fixed a potential crash during audio clip preview (related to irrKlang .NET library we use).
 - Fixed a potential resource leak in the sprite preview.

Engine:
 - Fixed IsKeyPressed script function returning values other than 0 or 1 (broke some scripts).
 - Fixed grey-out effect over disabled GUI controls was drawn at the wrong coordinates.


VERSION 3.5.0, December 2019

Common features:
 - Now using Allegro v4.4.3 library (previously v4.4.2).
 - Support for large files: compiled game, sprite set, room files now may exceed 2 GB.
 - Deprecated relative assets resolutions: now sprites, rooms and fonts are considered to
   match game's resolution by default and not resized, unless running in backwards-compatibility
   mode.
 - Allow room size to be smaller than the game's resolution.
 - Removed fonts count limit.
 - Raised imported sprites count limit to 90000 and removed total sprite count limit
   (this means you may have around 2 billions of dynamic sprites).
 - Removed length limit on the Button and TextBox text (was 50 and 200 respectively).
 - Removed limit on ListBox item count (was 200).

Editor:
 - Editor requires .NET Framework 4.5 to run. Dropped Windows XP support.
 - Editor preferences are now stored using .NET configuration model, instead of the
   Windows registry.
 - Added support for custom UI color themes.
 - Added "Window" - "Layout" submenu with commands for saving and loading panel layout.
 - Game and room templates are now by default saved in AppData/Local/AGS folder.
   Editor finds them in both program folder and AppData.
 - Allow to change IDs of most of the game items in the project tree by swapping two
   existing items. This is done by calling a context menu and choosing "Change ID".
 - Added "Game file name" option to let users easily set compiled game file's name.
 - Added "Allow relative asset resolutions" option to "Backwards Compatibility" section.
   Disabled by default, it makes game treat all sprites and rooms resolution as real one.
 - Added "Custom Say/Narrate function in dialog scripts" options which determine what
   functions are used when converting character lines in dialog scripts to real script.
   IMPORTANT: this does not currently work with the "Say" checkbox. The workaround is as before:
   duplicate option text as a first spoken line in the dialog script.
 - New revamped sprite import window.
 - Sprites that were created using tiled import can now be properly reimported from source.
 - Added context menu command to open sprite's source file location.
 - Using Magick.NET library as a GIF loader. This should fix faulty GIF imports.
 - New sprite export dialog that lets you configure some export preferences, including
   remapping sprite source paths.
 - Sprites have "Real" resolution type by default. "Low" and "High resolution" are kept
   for backwards compatibility only. When importing older games resolution type will be
   promoted to "Real" whenever it matches the game.
 - New navigation bar in the room editor, which allows to select any room object
   or region for editing, show/hide and lock room objects and regions in any combination.
   These settings are saved in the special roomXXX.crm.user files.
 - Improved how Room zoom slider works, now supports downscale.
 - Added "Export mask to file" tool button to the Room Editor.
 - Added MaskResolution property to Rooms. It ranges from 1:1 to 1:4 and lets you define
   the precision of Hotspot, Regions and Walkable Areas relative to room background.
 - Added "Default room mask resolution" to General Settings, which value will be applied
   to any room opened for editing in this game for the first time.
 - Added "Scale movement speed with room's mask resolution" to General Settings.
 - Removed Locked property from the Room Object, objects are now locked by the navbar.
 - Split GUI's Visibility property into PopupStyle and Visible properties.
 - Added Clickable, Enabled and Visible properties to GUI Controls.
 - "Import over font" command now supports importing WFN fonts too.
 - Removed "Fonts designed for high resolution" option from General Settings. Instead added
   individual SizeMultiplier property to Fonts.
 - Alphabetically sort audio clips in the drop lists.
 - Display audio clip length on the preview pane without starting playback.
 - Now packages Audio and Speech files using extended pack format, allowing longer filenames;
   This also removes a 4-digit limit on speech file numbers; was 1-9999 per character,
   now up to 2 billion due to how engine handles these.
 - Sync variable type selector in Global Variables pane with the actual list of supported
   script types.
 - Added ThreadedAudio property to Default Setup.
 - In preferences added an option telling whether to automatically reload scripts changed
   externally.
 - Added "Always" choice to "Popup message on compile" preference. Successful compilation
   popup will only be displayed if "Always" choice is selected.
 - Added shortcut key combination (Shift + F5) for stopping a game's debug run.
 - Don't display missing games in the "recent games" list.
 - Editor now checks for missing sprite data in the spritefile, replacing affected sprites

 - Fixed autocomplete not showing up correctly if user has multiple monitors.
 - Fixed autocomplete crashing with empty /// comments.
 - Fixed script compiler could leave extra padding inside the compiled scripts filled with
   random garbage if script strings contained escaped sequences like "\n" (this was not good
   for source control).

Scripting:
 - Fixed compiler was not allowing to access regular properties after type's static properties
   in a sequence (for example: DateTime.Now.Hour).

Script API:
 - Introduced new managed struct Point describing (x,y) coordinates.
 - Introduced StringCompareStyle enum and replaced "caseSensitive" argument in String functions
   with argument of StringCompareStyle type.
 - Implemented Dictionary and Set script classes supporting storage and lookup of strings and
   key/value pairs in sorted or unsorted way. Added SortStyle enum for use with them.
 - Implemented Viewport and Camera script classes which control how room is displayed on screen.
 - Implemented Screen struct with a number of static functions and properties, which notably
   features references to the existing Viewports. Deprecated System's ScreenWidth, ScreenHeight,
   ViewportWidth and ViewportHeight in favor of Screen's properties.
 - Added Game.Camera, Game.Cameras and Game.CameraCount properties.
 - All functions that find room objects under screen coordinates are now being clipped by the
   viewport (fail if there's no room viewport at these coordinates). This refers to:
   GetLocationName, GetLocationType, IsInteractionAvailable, Room.ProcessClick, GetWalkableAreaAt
   and all of the GetAtScreenXY functions (and corresponding deprecated functions).
 - Added Character.GetAtRoomXY, Hotspot.GetAtRoomXY, Object.GetAtRoomXY, Region.GetAtScreenXY,
   replaced GetWalkableAreaAt with GetWalkableAreaAtScreen and added GetWalkableAreaAtRoom.
 - Replaced Alignment enum with a new one which has eight values from TopLeft to BottomRight.
 - Renamed old Alignment enum to HorizontalAlignment, intended for parameters that are
   only allowed to be Left, Center or Right.
 - Added new script class TextWindowGUI, which extends GUI class and is meant to access
   text-window specific properties: TextColor and TextPadding.
 - Added new properties to GUI class: AsTextWindow (readonly), BackgroundColor, BorderColor,
   PopupStyle (readonly), PopupYPos.
 - Added Button.TextAlignment and Label.TextAlignment.
 - Added missing properties for ListBox: SelectedBackColor, SelectedTextColor, TextAlignment,
   TextColor.
 - Replaced ListBox.HideBorder and HideArrows with ShowBorder and ShowArrows.
 - Added TextBox.ShowBorder.
 - Added AudioClip.ID which corresponds to clip's position in Game.AudioClips array.
 - Added Game.PlayVoiceClip() for playing non-blocking voice.
 - Added SkipCutscene() and eSkipScriptOnly cutscene mode.

 - Added Game.SimulateKeyPress().
 - Added optional "frame" parameter to Character.Animate and Object.Animate, letting you begin
   animation from any frame in the loop.
 - Deprecated "system" object (not System struct!).
 - Deprecated Character.IgnoreWalkbehinds and Object.IgnoreWalkbehinds.
 - Deprecated DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates. Also, assigning it will be ignored if game's
   "Allow relative asset resolutions" option is disabled.

Engine:
 - New pathfinder based on the A* jump point search.
 - Implemented new savegame format. Much cleaner than the old one, and easier to
   extend, it should also reduce the size of the save files.
   The engine is still capable of loading older saves, temporarily.
 - Implemented support for sprite batch transformations.
 - Implemented custom room viewport and camera.
 - Removed limits on built-in text wrapping (was 50 lines of 200 chars max each).
 - Removed 200 chars limit for DoOnceOnly token length.
 - Try to create all subdirectories when calling File.Open() for writing,
   DynamicSprite.SaveToFile() and Game.SetSaveGameDirectory().
 - Reimplemented threaded audio, should now work correctly on all platforms.
 - Made debug overlay (console and fps counter) display above any game effects (tint, fade, etc)
 - Made fps display more stable and timing correct when framerate is maxed out for test purposes.
 - Print debug overlay text using Game.NormalFont (was hard-coded to default speech font).
 - Improved performance of hardware-accelerated renderers by not preparing a stage bitmap
   for plugins unless any plugin hooked for the particular drawing events.
 - Reimplemented FRead and FWrite plugin API functions, should now work in 64-bit mode too.
 - Support "--gfxdriver" command line argument that overrides graphics driver in config.
 - Implemented "--tell" set of commands that print certain engine and/or game data to stdout.
 - Use "digiid" and "midiid" config options to be used on all platforms alike and allow these to
   represent driver ID as a plain string and encoded as an integer value (for compatibility).
 - Completely removed old and unsupported record/replay functionality.
 - Replaced number of fatal errors reported for incorrectly called script functions with
   a warning to the warnings.log instead. This is done either when arguments may be fixed
   automatically, or script command simply cannot be executed under current circumstances.
 - Expanded some of the error messages providing more information to end-user and developers.
 - Fixed engine could not locate game data if relative path was passed in command line.
 - Fixed potential bug which could cause DoOnceOnly tokens to be read incorrectly from a savedgame.
 - Fixed engine crashing with "division by zero" error if user set InventoryWindow's ItemWidth or
   ItemHeight to 0.
 - Fixed engine crashing if Object.SetView is called with a view that does not have any loops.
 - Fixed old walk-behind cut-outs could be displayed on first update in a room if the room's
   background was modified using raw drawing commands before fade-in. This happened only when
   running Direct3D or OpenGL renderer. Note that this bug was probably never noticed by players
   for a certain barely related reason.
 - Fixed BlackBox-in transition done by software renderer could have wrong aspect ratio.
 - Fixed Direct3D and OpenGL displayed pink (255, 0, 255) fade as transparent.
 - Fixed Direct3D was slightly distorting game image in pixel perfect mode.
 - Fixed Direct3D was not clearing black borders in fullscreen, which could cause graphical
   artifacts remaining after the Steam overlay, for example.
 - Fixed potential crash that could happen when switching between fullscreen and windowed mode,
   or switching back into game window (only observed on Linux for some reason).
 - Fixed a bug in mp3/ogg decoder where it assumed creating an audiostream succeeded without
   actually testing one.

Linux:
 - Use same FreeType library sources as Windows version, which suppose to fix TTF font glitches.
 - Re-enabled threaded audio setting.
 - $APPDATADIR$ script paths are now mapped to "$XDG_DATA_HOME/ags-common", making sure it is a
   writeable location.

Windows:
 - Windows version of AGS is now built with MSVS 2015 and higher.
 - Engine is marked as a DPI-aware application that supposed to prevent window scaling by system.

WinSetup:
 - Added "Enable threaded audio" checkbox.

Editor:
 - Removed legacy game compiler.
 - Raw compiled game data is now saved in "Compiled\Data" folder, as opposed to
   just "Compiled".
 - The speech.vox file is now not recompiled if game is quick-run (using F5).
   Engine is supposed to find newer files in the Speech folder.
 - Editor can now import games older than 2.72, and newer too (3.*) if you have
   extracted data files from compiled executable.
 - ScriptAPIVersion and ScriptCompatibilityLevel settings now have "Highest"
   option, which is meant for automatically enabling newest script API when
   upgrading old project in a newer editor.
 - Added new "Default Setup" pane, which works similarily to "General Settings"
   and lets you configure default values for game setup.
 - Added "Font Height (pixels)" readonly property to the Font's pane, which
   works for both WFN and TTF fonts and may be used as a reference.
 - Made Editor correctly detect modern versions of MS Windows for display on
   About dialog and when sending anonymous statistics.
 - New application icon to comply with 3.4.0 splash screen.
 - Fixed crash when importing old games which have extended editor version
   string saved in the project files.
 - Few improvements to the game compilation made in hope to reduce occasional
   data corruption.

Script:
 - Fixed local variables not working in the switch's case expressions.
 - Fixed Strings in switch, making them compare by value again.
 - Fixed compiler mistakes caused by the use of objects of empty type
   (that is - struct without any variables in it).
 - Fixed few cases of possible compiler crashing when there is an unfinished
   statement in the end of the script.
 - Fixed unhandled exception occuring when user types "#undef", "#ifdef" or "#ifndef"
   on the last line of the script.
 - Fixed #ifver and #ifnver not working properly if version number had only one
   component (major version).

   LockViewAligned, LockViewFrame, LockViewOffset, UnlockView. This parameter
   can be eStopMoving (default) or eKeepMoving.
 - DynamicSprite.CreateFromFile and SaveToFile now support path tokens and
   comply to the new file path rules (no writing files to the game's
   installation directory).
 - Added missing readonly properties to get Lighting/Tinting parameters for
   Character and Object: HasExplicitLight, HasExplicitTint, LightLevel,
   TintBlue, TintGreen, TintRed, TintSaturation, TintLuminance.
 - Added Mouse.SelectPreviousMode() and Mouse.IsModeEnabled(CursorMode)
   functions.
 - Added readonly properties to get Button's animation state: Button.Animating,
   Button.Frame, Button.Loop, Button.View.
 - Added GetFontHeight(FontType) and GetFontLineSpacing(FontType) functions.
 - Added setter for System.Windowed property, letting to change it at runtime,
   switching between windowed and fullscreen modes.
 - Added System.RenderAtScreenResolution property to change sprite rendering
   mode at runtime.

Engine:
 - Added OpenGL renderer to Windows version.
 - Partial support for plugins drawing on screen for hardware-accelerated
   renderers (Direct3D, OpenGL).
 - Added support for switching between fullscreen and windowed modes at runtime
   using Alt+Enter key combination.
 - All supported renderers now run 16-bit and 32-bit games in 32-bit display
   mode by default, and convert game's graphics on load if that is required.
   Hardware-accelerated renderers (Direct3D and OpenGL) are also allowed to run
   8-bit games, converting graphics to 32-bit at runtime.
   This measure improves Software renderer work on contemporary systems, and fixes
   loss of green hue precision in 16-bit games when they are run with Direct3D or
   OpenGL.
   NOTE: 8-bit dynamic palette cycling is still not supported for hardware-
   accelerated drivers.
 - Added support for global configuration file, which works as configuration
   for all games and overrides default game's config file. Individual game
   user's config overrides global one in its turn. Global config's location is
   platform-dependent (this feature is currently disabled on Windows).
 - Implemented separate config option for game's shared data path, to keep it
   distinct from user-defined saves path.
 - Engine saves last Windowed and RenderAtScreenResolution mode states to the
   user config file.
 - Engine no longer writes and reads gamma level in saves, meaning that gamma
   keeps its current value when restoring a saved game.
 - Removed arbitrary limit on number of sprites rendered at the same time for
   hardware-accelerated renderers (Direct3D and OpenGL) (was 75), and another
   limit imposed on drawing entries for all drivers (was 200).
 - Engine now tries to get voice files from the Speech folder first, if one
   exists, and speech.vox later when quick-run from the Editor.
 - Fixed speech portrait was displayed below GUI, contrary to speech text.
 - Fixed ShakeScreen command was causing graphic artifacts when game is run
   with software renderer.
 - Fixed calling ChangeView during idle animation results in new view being animated.
 - Fixed Speech.SkipStyle getter return value for eSkipTime case.
 - Fixed Speech.VoiceMode not returning correct values when speech.vox is not
   enabled/present.
 - Fixed AdjustVolumeWithScaling character's property not working with the new
   audio system.
 - Fixed volume drop was not applied to audio clips which begin playing during
   speech voice-over.
 - Fixed Game.SetAudioTypeSpeechVolumeDrop did not affect currently playing
   clips until next voice-over begins.
 - Fixed Game.TranslationFilename returning "default" instead of empty string
   if no translation is set.
 - Fixed engine was trying to locate "My Documents" folder on Windows Vista and
   higher even though it did not need it, and reporting internal error if such
   folder was not found, even though "Saved Games" folder is used instead.
 - Properly toggle console upon play.debug_mode variable change in script.
 - Added missing stubs for agsjoy plugin.

WinSetup:
 - Fixed display mode selection was missing certain items.


VERSION 3.4.0 - Patch 4, March 2017

Editor:
 - Improved Font preview, now it displays all 256 supported characters and
   resizes itself to accomodate these on the grid properly.
 - Fixed game compilation on systems which have Japanese ANSI or similar locale
   as default locale for non-Unicode applications.
 - Fixed Linux binaries were not copied to the Compiled folder if AGS Editor is
   installed to "C:/Program Files" and run in a non-administrator mode.
  
Engine:
 - Fixed toggling mouse lock in window with Ctrl+Alt did not work all the time.

Script API:
 - Extended the list of System.OperatingSystem possible return values;
   now supports eOSAndroid, eOSiOS, eOSPSP

Editor bug fixes:
 - Fixed incorrect Unicode-to-ANSI string conversion during game compilation
   which caused text containing non-latin characters become random mess in game,
   even if game fonts compiled to the proper ANSI codepage.

Engine bug fixes:
 - Fixed mouse cursor stuck at the left border of the screen when using OpenGL
   renderer (Android & iOS ports).
 - Fixed InventoryScreen() script function caused game to crash if particular
   resources are not available.
 - Fixed built-in inventory screen not working with Direct3D and OpenGL
   renderers.
 - Fixed obsolete gfxfilter names are printed when using --help argument.

Cosmetics & convenience:

   disk (e.g. no more telling to not run from CD on Android).
  
Manual:
 - Added information on static extenders.


VERSION 3.4.0 - Patch 1, November 2016

Editor:
 - Fixed #if(n)ver preprocessor directive failed to properly compare versions

   so that the engine would be able to use old config files.
 - Fixed graphics mode initialization failure in certain less common setup
   cases, such as when requested window size was larger than current
   desktop resolution, or when the final mode appeared smaller than the
   precalculated one.
 - Fixed couple of memory leaks occuring when saved game is restored.
 - Fixed rare crash when restoring a game while having unreleased DrawingSurface
   pointers.

  drag/drop (and not only for scripts). The script dependency rule remains the same
  (lower scripts can import symbols from upper ones, but not vice versa).

 - Added "pick up" as an extra normal mode - you can, of course, use it
   to mean whatever you want. Cursor mode 5 ("DENIED") represents it (mode 5
   is no longer used by the engine so it's spare for this use).
 - Added special tokens for use in global and room messages, which allow
   you to insert variable values into the message. See section 3.2.4 in the
   manual for how to use these.
 - Added "don't automatically lose inventory" option, which turns off the
   default behaviour of losing the item when a "Use inventory" event happens.
 - The unhandled_event function is now called when the player uses an
   unhandled inventory item on a hotspot/object (previously it was only
   called if there was no "Use inventory" response defined).
 - Added ability to import tiled sprites from a source bitmap file. See
   section 3.2.3 in the manual for how to use this feature.
 - Added "Test game" button to Game, Main tab of roomedit, which shells AGS
   and runs your game without you leaving the editor.
 - A Lucasarts-style GUI is now included in the AGS distribution - just import
   the LUCASART.GUI file to use it. Thanks to Jeremie Lumbroso.

 - Fixed bug where roomedit crashed if your game contained more than 80 files.

VERSION 2.06, March 2000
 - Added character numbers, so that characters can be moved/animated using
   the Animation Editor. Just use the character's number +100 as the object
   number. For example, use "Move To 100,50" with Object as 102 will move
   character 2. The Character Editor shows the character numbers.
 - Finally fixed the text size in high-resolution modes.
 - Added scroll bar to character editor, so you can now have up to 50 instead
   of 15 characters.
 - Added "Enters screen after fade-in" event, which works like the "Player

 - Fixed bug in roomedit with animating backgrounds
 - Allowed to get back into roomedit if error with dialog script; however,

VERSION 2.05, February 2000

 - RoomEdit now uses a crosshair mouse cursor when drawing walk-behinds and
   hotspots, to enable you to better see what's under the cursor.
 - Added support for importing a BMP/PCX file as the mask for hotspot/walk-
   behind/etc. See section 3.3.4 in the manual for information.
 - Added support for export/import of characters, which allows you to share
   characters between games and with others on the internet. The end of
   section 3.2.7 in the manual describes this.

 - RoomEdit now allows scrolling up/down the inventory list, so you can have
   more than 15 inventory items (max 99 now).

   circumstances.

 - Added GetPalette and SetPalette text script functions, to allow you to
   do things to the entire palette. New variable type "palette", which you
   use with these functions.

 - Removed the room password option: it was a left-over from AC v1, and now
   that you can build an exe file of your game, it's not really needed.
 - NOTE: The Windows version has not been updated to 2.05 - the included
   acwin.exe is still the v2.04 version. This is due to time constraints and
   pressure to release 2.05 as soon as possible; the Win version still has
   the room changing bug, so it's not worth including until I work on that.

VERSION 2.04, January 2000
 - Added Sierra-style close-up-face option for speech display in conversations.
 - Added object naming, so that moving the mouse over objects in a Lucasarts
   interface displays a proper name, instead of "OBJECT 0".
 - Added option to make a character invisible to the hit-testing, so that the
   main character can't be interacted with (like the Lucasarts games).
 - Added pixel-perfect click detection option, so that clicking a transparent
   pixel of an object/character doesn't trigger the interaction.
 - Added option to use top-left pixel of sprite as transparent colour instead
   of just colour index 0.
 - Added support for using a background picture for text windows. To use this,
   just go to your text-window interface in the Interface Editor, then right-
   click the background, choose Properties, then click the "COL/PIC" button
   and type the slot number you want to use. The picture will NOT be tiled
   or stretched (but it will be clipped to fit the window), so you should make
   sure it is large enough for the biggest text windows (about 250x100 should
   be enough).
 - Added ability to delete sprites in the Sprite Manager.
 - Added SaveScreenShot text script function.
 - Added option to treat Walk mode as a normal mode, so that the character
   isn't automatically moved but instead a normal event is triggered when
   you click to move.
 - Modified RoomEdit so that when you click a "Display Message" interaction
   command, it provides a list of messages in the room to choose from, instead
   of prompting you for the message number. If there are no messages it will
   ask for the number, just like before (this means you can still set up the
   interactions before actually typing the messages in, if you want to).
 - Fixed bug where the player lost the inventory item when Data 99 was used.
 - Made some improvements to the beta of the Windows version.

VERSION 2.03, November 1999
IMPORTANT: Your game, and all your room files, need to be upgraded to use the
latest version. To upgrade, simply load and save in the Room Editor. You must
do this for EVERY ROOM in your game. Sorry, but it's to support the upcoming
Windows version.
 - Allowed creation of very wide (eg. 700x200) lo-res scrolling rooms.
 - New text script functions MoveCharacterToHotspot, DisplaySpeech, NewRoomEx.
 - Lucasarts-style inventory window.
 - Changed background importing - now, it just asks what resolution the
   drawing is supposed to be, instead of trying to work it out. This allows
   scrolling rooms of any size in any resolution.
 - Changed the way the Room Editor works with games - instead of running it
   from the directory which the game is in, it creates each game a
   sub-directory below the main RoomEdit/AGS directory. This makes it much
   easier to edit the demo game, and should solve problems with files not
   being found and so on. What this means for you is that if you are working
   on a game with its files in the RoomEdit directory, create a sub-directory
   and copy all your game files (*.crm, ac2game.*, etc) into it.
   Another result of this is that the usergame.exe is now called by the game
   directory's name, and placed in the main AGS directory.
 - Non-player objects can now be moved with the animation command "Move to",
   and also with a new text script command MoveObject.
 - Added graphical script command "Run dialog" (it's under "Remove object" if
   you can't find it).
 - Added "Save room" as well as "Save room as" to Room Editor. This option
   saves back to the same file you loaded from, which is quicker than having
   to select the right file to save to every time.
 - Slightly modified the background scene remapper: it now puts the background
   colours starting from the end of the palette and working backwards; this
   makes it easier if you want to increase the number of sprite colours part
   way through making a game. Otherwise this change is transparent to you.
 - Added ability to "lock" objects in the Room Editor. While an object is
   locked, it cannot be moved around the screen. Useful if you keep getting the
   wrong object when you're trying to move a different one.
 - Increased a few limits: now 100 views, 200 dialog topic, 900 dialog messages.
 - Fixed bug where "music0.mp3 not found" flashed on the screen breifly.
 - Fixed the interface text @overhotspot@ to include object & character names.
 - Included beta version of Windows port! See AGSWIN.TXT for information.

VERSION 2.02, September 1999
 - Fixed bug where you were unable to save the game.
 - Character names can use lower case
 - New option "Player can't skip speech" prevents the player clicking away
   conversation text, like the way the Lucasarts games won't let you.
 - Character walks to the walk-to point of a hotspot in Walk mode (as well
   as use/speak mode). This makes it more like the Lucasarts interface.
 - Fixed SCI font importing bug, and added an Auto-Recover feature so that if
   it does crash in future, then it won't permanently disable the Fonts tab.
 - Added sprite import support for 640x400-resolution object graphics.
 - Added crash protection to the StrCat function, so that it won't add text
   past the maximum string length instead of crashing the system.
 - New MIDI driver: Software wavetable synth, uses the digital sound driver
   to play MIDI music using General MIDI patch set. By using this driver, your
   MIDI music can sound the same on ALL sound cards. See section 2.2.1 in the
   docs for information.
 - Changed the way that the mouse cursor hotspot setting works - it's clearer
   what's going on now.
 - Added engine debugging options. See the TECHDBG.TXT file for information.

VERSION 2.01, September 1999
NOTE: You will need to upgrade your game to use the new engine. To do this,
simply load the game into the Room Editor and then save it again.
 - Characters can now have a Talking view, which allows animation in dialogs
 - Fixed bug in dialogs where various messages screwed up
 - Fixed bug where interface text color was always black
 - Dialog options can now wrap to more than one line
 - Hotspot names can be longer and use lowercase
 - Fixed scaling bug where he sometimes popped up full-size briefly
 - Fixed crash if you pressed a key while in a conversation
 - Fixed background importing bug where colour index 0 screwed up
 - Added custom font support; but currently, you can only import SCI fonts.
 - Added graphical script command "If inventory %d was used"; allows you to
   use graphical scripts with Data-99 inventory events.
 - Documented RunDialog text script function
 - In View Editor, setting graphic for new frame zooms to previous frame's
   graphic in sprite list
 - User-defined gap between display of options in conversations
 - Interface button properties has "..." button to link to script editor if
   the left-click action is set to Run Script.
 - You can export the palette to PCX as well as PAL file.
 - When saving game, RoomEdit also checks for AC.EXE in the roomedit.exe
   directory as well as the current directory. So editing the demo by typing
   ..\roomedit will allow it to compile properly.
 - Fixed game loading bug where the graphical script timer wasn't restored
 - Allowed 320-width sprite import in room editor (if you drag the rectangle
   to screen width, it imports what's under the rectangle border as well as
   what's inside).

VERSION 2.00, September 1999
Complete re-write of both the Room Editor and the engine. Some of the new
features are:
 - Character scaling: man can get smaller as he walks away from the screen.
 - Customizable interface: you're not stuck with the Sierra one any more.

   roaming the world and keep track of where they are.

 - Increased max loops per view to 8 instead of 4.
 - Customizable walking speed for main character.
 - Baselines for objects, useful for objects lying flat on the ground, so that
   the man doesn't walk behind them.
 - You can change the icon bar graphics.
 - You can build a single EXE file for your game. This goes one step further
   than the data file you could build in the last version.
 - Improved remapping of scenes and sprites, solves most of the palette
   problems people were having with importing their graphics.
 - Clarified LICENSE.TXT. You should read the new license agreement.

VERSION 1.14a, May 1999

   of the same screen. Section 3.13.1 in the docs describes this.
 - You can customize the score sound and the red-X sound. See ScoreSoundCustom
   and ErrorSoundCustom in section 4.1 of the docs.
 - Added support for customizable borders for the text windows. Section 4.1.1
   in the docs explains how to use this feature.
 - Added option to move man as close as possible to destination instead of
   displaying red X. See "MoveNearest" in section 4.1 of the docs for info.
 - Added XM music support. See section 3.2 of the docs.
 - The intro system has been changed. Now, the games starts in INTRO.CRM if
   it exists rather than displaying PIC1.PCX. See section 3.15 in the docs.
   The demo game intro now has two screens.
 - You can now change music volume on a per-room basis. This allows you to
   have, for example, quieter music outside a building than when the player
   enters it (like with the shops in the arcade in SQ4).
 - New graphical script commands: "Start timer", "when timer expires" and "move
   man to object". See section 4.6 in the docs.
 - New animation command "place object" allows you to instantly move an object
   to another position (see section 4.5 in the docs).
 - Added Swedish translation by Arn.
 - Fixed bug where man would 'moonwalk' when he reached destination (I think -
   still waiting for confirmation that this is fixed).
 - Mod musics are now included in your data file (sorry about that!).
 - Objects are now drawn behind the status bar if they are that high up.
 - Fixed bug causing mouse droppings to be left on the screen when the player
   scored points.
 - Fixed bug where you had to click twice to make the man walk off the left
   and bottom of the screen.
 - Fixed bug in RoomMake where the load/save room dialogs could 'disappear'.
 - Fixed lsl3-type score ticking (it works now!)
 - Fixed text colour problem in restore/save/quit dialogs.
 - Fixed spelling of "perhaps" on the second screen of the demo. At last!

VERSION 1.13, March 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games made with previous versions.
NOTE: You cannot load old save game positions saved before this version.
 - Added "every time player enters screen" and "repeatedly execute" events. See
   section 4.3 in the docs for information.
 - Added "move to, ignoring walls" animation command, allows you to give the
   effect of the character walking through a door otherwise blocked, etc.
   Also, you can now set a repeating animation in the Animation Editor. See
   section 4.5 in the docs for info.
 - New Sierra-style inventory window! See section 4.1.3 in the docs for how to
   implement this.
 - Added graphical script commands "If player has inventory item", "Lose
   inventory item", "Every x loops" and "Random chance". See section 4.6 in
   the documentation for more info.
 - You can now use your own custom mouse cursors. See "Cursor" in section 4.1
   of the documentation.
 - Different cursor now used in dialog boxes and the like, allows for a proper
   walk cursor which isn't used everywhere else.
 - NEW: Windows version of the Project Manager.
 - The route-finder is now much quicker at working out whether you can get
   to the destination, so clicking on walls no longer pauses the game for ages.
 - New: MOD support for background music. You can now use mod files as well
   as midi files. See section 3.2 in the docs.
 - The "Go to screen" command is finally implemented in graphical scripts.
 - New: Global flags in graphical scripts. The demo game now demonstrates
   this (the cigarette appears on the bin screen once you've given the key
   to the man).
 - Choice of two fonts for the speech text - the original one or now an SQ4
   type speech font as well. See "SpeechFont" in section 4.1 of the docs.
 - The status bar is now fully (well, almost!) customizable. Section 4.1.2 in
   the docs describes how to do this.
 - You can change the colour and style of the message boxes. See section 4.1.1
   in the docs for info.
 - You can set messages to be removed after a time if the player has not
   clicked the mouse - useful for intros/animations/etc. See the end of
   section 2.5 in the docs for info.
 - The Sprite Manager can now scroll up/down if you have more sprites than fit
   on the screen. The maximum is now 500 imported sprites.
 - When the character dies, you can now have a "Restore or quit" dialog rather
   than exiting the game.
 - You can now draw double-thickness walls in the Room Editor. This saves a lot
   of time so you don't have to draw walls twice.
 - Speech text is now centred horizontally on the screen.
 - The score is not displayed in the status bar if TotalScore is set to 0.
   This allows for some games where you don't want to use the scoring system.
 - You can now set the icon bar to display on top of the status bar, instead
   of below it. See IconBarAbsTop in section 4.1 of the docs for info.
 - You can change the animation speed of the main character. Useful if you are
   using custom character graphics. See ManAnimSpeed in sect 4.1 in the docs.
 - The up/down facing view is now used when the character is going more
   vertically than horizontally, instead of only when going North or South.
 - Using foreign characters in save game descriptions no longer crashes.
 - The icon bar is now not displayed while the status bar is disabled.
 - Added Green speech text colour option. Oh yes!
 - In the demo game, once the door is unlocked you can now go through it by
   using the hand cursor.
 - A couple of people reported that their graphics cards couldn't do 640x400.
   Now, if RoomMake can't use 640x400 it will use a 640x480 mode with black
   borders at the top and bottom.
 - Added teleport-to-room command in debug mode lets you test things without
   having to play your whole game through.
 - The main character's colours have been slightly changed. He doesn't look as
   good now, but it stops the problems which were happening to some scenes.
 - The Room Editor can no longer save old format room files :-(  But I don't
   think you really want to go back to v1.00 now, do you?
 - Fixed bug causing colours 190 and 191 to be overridden (thanks Arn!).
 - Fixed bug where changing screen the main character would temporarily change
   to the standard front view.
 - Fixed bug where objects positions weren't saved if they were turned off.
 - Fixed bug in save games with some text scripts.
 - Fixed room loading bug which showed up occasionally on graphical scripts.
 - Fixed crash which happened when pressing the down arrow key in the Restore
   game dialog when there were no save games (yes, arcane but true! try it on
   an older version and see!)

VERSION 1.12a, February 1999
NOTE: You cannot load old save game positions saved before this version.
 - You can now move non-player objects with the "Move object" animation
   command.
 - Non-player objects are now drawn correctly when in walk-behind areas.
 - Fixed the bug where objects sometimes weren't being removed from the screen
   properly, like the poster in the demo game.
 - Better screen-changing routine which fades in with the objects on, so you
   don't get that sudden change effect.
 - Changing the man's graphics now actually works.
 - The current MIDI track and position are now saved in the save games. Woohoo!

VERSION 1.12, February 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games made with versions before this.
NOTE: You cannot load old save game positions saved before this version.
 - Added ability to change main character's graphic. See section 3.10 in the
   documentation for more information.
 - Added FLI/FLC animation support
 - Added simple animation support, so you can have, for example, a door
   actually opening. See section 3.11 in the documentation for info.
 - You can use Data column values in graphical script
 - New response "Turn object on" allows you to put back an object you removed
   with "Remove object".
 - You can now disable the main character in a room - this allows you to do
   things like close-ups of a control panel. This is now demonstrated in the
   demo game, and described in section 3.12.
 - You can now set an object to initally off in RoomMake, which you can turn
   on later using "Turn object on".
 - Added Finnish translation by Teemu Eramaa and Norwegian translation by
   Martin Seterstoen.
 - You can now import a portion of a PCX/BMP for object graphics. This allows
   you to draw several frames in one file, and then import each frame from the
   same graphic.
 - New option in the Sprite Manager allows you to use full 256-colour palette
   for imports if the graphic will only be used in one room. (This prevents
   the mapping to greyscale).
 - The Sprite Manager importer now preserves colour 0 (transparent) pixels in
   the imported image.
 - You can change the background music through a command as well as with the
   room option.
 - Improved message editor allows you to edit existing messages without having
   to re-type the whole thing and also allows longer messages.
 - Tweaked the auto-route finder: removed the bug where he would sometimes
   walk further than you asked, and shortened the time the routefinder is
   allowed before giving up. This means that it is quicker realizing that you
   can't get somewhere, but it may not be able to work out a path round
   complex obstacles.
 - Pressing 'N' in object editor now uses Sprite manager to select graphic
   instead of cycling through all available graphs.
 - Fixed a silly bug with the Go-to-screen data column value where he would
   appear on the wrong side.
 - The walk and hand icons have now been replaced.
 - Slowed down the animation speed of the main character, so he looks more
   like he's walking.
 - F1 now works in the Sprite Manager! Oh yes!
 - Fixed bug in RoomMake which crashed when you moved the mouse to the bottom
   of the screen.

VERSION 1.1, January 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games made with versions before this
version. If you do not, you will not be able to run the game with this version.
NOTE: The files needed to distribute your games have changed. Please see
section 6.2 of the docs for information.
 - Added SVGA support. Background scenes can now be up to 640x400 256-colour!
   Please read section 3.9 in AC.DOC for notes on this new feature.
 - Added background music support, using MIDI files (see section 3.2 of AC.DOC
   for information).
 - Added sound effect support (see section 4.2 in AC.DOC for info).
 - Character movement by mouse added: click on the destination and he will
   walk there, as in Sierra's VGA games.
 - New compression algorithm for room files, leading to smaller files. In fact,
   the room file is now sometimes smaller than the imported scene's PCX file!
 - Foreign language support added.
 - Portuguese translation by Nuno Costa.
 - You can now import your own PCX/BMP files as graphics for objects.
 - Support for animating background sprites added. SUPPORT is the key word
   here, because currently I've only drawn one animating sprite.
 - The first screen of the demo has been changed to show off SVGA and
   animating sprites. And it looks better like this.
 - Expanded text script to make it more powerful. It still doesn't rival AGI
   for power, but you can now print out variable values and do crude intro
   sequences. See section 4.4 in the documentation for information.
 - New, much better icons for the top icon bar.
 - Slowed down the time-of-day to a fixed rate (on fast systems it was
   changing from day to night to day far too quickly).
 - Keypad 5 now stops the character walking properly.
 - Ported the run-time engine to DJGPP (a 32-bit DOS system).
 - You can now remove the status bar. Wow!

SERVICE RELEASE 1, December 1998
NOTE: Save games created by this release are not readable with previous
versions; and this version cannot load old save games. Sorry. If you try to
load an old game, you'll get Oops error 600. This is the price of progress :-)
You CAN, however, still use old rooms (so you haven't lost anything - phew!)
 - Added graphical script editor to RoomMake. This allows easy advanced
   scripting without using the .SCR file. See the AC.DOC file for more info.
 - RoomMake has been ported to DPMI. No more memory problems running RoomMake!
 - RoomMake now has an improved user interface:
    * a new file selector which allows changing directory and is easier to use
    * improved other dialogs, such as the "Are you sure you want to Quit"
      dialog and the "enter password" dialog.
    * supports long filenames if run under Windows 95, 98, or LFNDOS.
    * better palette remapping when reading in a PCX file.
    * supports importing BMP files as a background scene
 - The old screen now fades out and the new one in when changing screens.
 - Corrected the bug which caused a crash if you used an object with certain
   graphics.
 - Corrected the crash which occured if the script file was newer than the
   compiled file (thanks Luke!)
 - One extra screen has been added to the demo game, and it now ends
   gracefully instead of with a Load_Room error.

REVISION 10.07.97
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games you made with any versions
before revision 10.07.97.A.
 - added StartPos option to INI file, to define where the man starts on
   the first screen. Also fixed the jump which happened when he first moved
   from the beginning.
 - removed the 'please register' nag screen, since I've decided that the
   Adventure Creator is now swap-ware (see LICENSE.TXT for info).

VERSION 1.00, FEBRUARY 1997
Original release.
