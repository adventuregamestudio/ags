REVISION HISTORY
================
VERSION 3.4.2 - Alpha

Common features:
 - Windows version of AGS is now built with MSVS 2015 and higher.

Editor:
 - Editor uses (and requires) .NET 4.0 and C# 6.0.
 - Added support for custom UI color themes.
 - Added navigation bar to the room editor, which allows to select any room object
   or region for editing.
 - Added ability to show/hide and lock room objects and regions in any combination,
   using the new navigation bar.
 - Added shortcut key combination (Shift + F5) for stopping a game's debug run.
 - Don't modify filesystem permissions in Compiled directory when compiling the game.
   Editor no longer requires non-standard "takeown.exe" utility.
 - Corrected .NET version query for the anonymous statistics report.

Engine:
 - Implemented new savegame format. Much cleaner than the old one, and easier to
   extend, it should also reduce the size of the save files.
   The engine is still capable of loading older saves, temporarily.
 - On Linux improved CPU yield function, this supposedly may reduce CPU usage.


VERSION 3.4.1 - Patch 1, January 2018

Engine:
 - Removed game error reported when GUI coordinates were off the room limits.
 - Fixed crash in Direct3D renderer when alt+tabbing out of fullscreen mode.
 - Fixed OpenGL fullscreen mode was not minimized when you alt+tab from it.
 - Fixed Direct3D and OpenGL renderers unnecessarily applied anti-aliasing on
   utility sprites (used for transition effects) when "smooth scaled sprites"
   option was enabled.


VERSION 3.4.1, December 2017

Common features:
 - Upgraded Windows version of AGS with Allegro v4.4 library (previously v4.2).
 - Implemented "RenderAtScreenResolution" game setting. When enabled, characters
   and objects are scaled in screen pixels rather than game pixels.
 - Implemented VerticalOffset and LineSpacing properties for fonts.
 - Removed limit on Dialog Topics (was 500 topics per game).
 - Removed length limit on the script names of Inventory, GUI and GUI Controls.
 - Removed length limit on the script names of Hotspots and Objects.
 - Removed length limit on event handler names.

Editor:
 - Removed legacy game compiler.
 - Raw compiled game data is now saved in "Compiled\Data" folder, as opposed to
   just "Compiled".
 - The speech.vox file is now not recompiled if game is quick-run (using F5).
   Engine is supposed to find newer files in the Speech folder.
 - Editor can now import games older than 2.72, and newer too (3.*) if you have
   extracted data files from compiled executable.
 - ScriptAPIVersion and ScriptCompatibilityLevel settings now have "Highest"
   option, which is meant for automatically enabling newest script API when
   upgrading old project in a newer editor.
 - Added new "Default Setup" pane, which works similarily to "General Settings"
   and lets you configure default values for game setup.
 - Added "Font Height (pixels)" readonly property to the Font's pane, which
   works for both WFN and TTF fonts and may be used as a reference.
 - Made Editor correctly detect modern versions of MS Windows for display on
   About dialog and when sending anonymous statistics.
 - New application icon to comply with 3.4.0 splash screen.
 - Fixed crash when importing old games which have extended editor version
   string saved in the project files.
 - Fixed unhandled exception occuring when user types "#under", "#idef" or "#ifndef"
   on the last line of the script.
 - Fixed #ifver and #ifnver not working properly if version number had only one
   component (major version).
 - Few improvements to the game compilation made in hope to reduce occasional
   data corruption.

Script:
 - Fixed local variables not working in the switch's case expressions.
 - Fixed Strings in switch, making them compare by value again.
 - Fixed compiler mistakes caused by the use of objects of empty type
   (that is - struct without any variables in it).
 - Fixed few cases of possible compiler crashing when there is an unfinished
   statement in the end of the script.

Script API:
 - A new parameter StopMovementStyle is added to following functions: LockView,
   LockViewAligned, LockViewFrame, LockViewOffset, UnlockView. This parameter
   can be eStopMoving (default) or eKeepMoving.
 - DynamicSprite.CreateFromFile and SaveToFile now support path tokens and
   comply to the new file path rules (no writing files to the game's
   installation directory).
 - Added missing readonly properties to get Lighting/Tinting parameters for
   Character and Object: HasExplicitLight, HasExplicitTint, LightLevel,
   TintBlue, TintGreen, TintRed, TintSaturation, TintLuminance.
 - Added Mouse.SelectPreviousMode() and Mouse.IsModeEnabled(CursorMode)
   functions.
 - Added readonly properties to get Button's animation state: Button.Animating,
   Button.Frame, Button.Loop, Button.View.
 - Added GetFontHeight(FontType) and GetFontLineSpacing(FontType) functions.
 - Added setter for System.Windowed property, letting to change it at runtime,
   switching between windowed and fullscreen modes.
 - Added System.RenderAtScreenResolution property to change sprite rendering
   mode at runtime.

Engine:
 - Added OpenGL renderer to Windows version.
 - Partial support for plugins drawing on screen for hardware-accelerated
   renderers (Direct3D, OpenGL).
 - Added support for switching between fullscreen and windowed modes at runtime
   using Alt+Enter key combination.
 - All supported renderers now run 16-bit and 32-bit games in 32-bit display
   mode by default, and convert game's graphics on load if that is required.
   Hardware-accelerated renderers (Direct3D and OpenGL) are also allowed to run
   8-bit games, converting graphics to 32-bit at runtime.
   This measure improves Software renderer work on contemporary systems, and fixes
   loss of green hue precision in 16-bit games when they are run with Direct3D or
   OpenGL.
   NOTE: 8-bit dynamic palette cycling is still not supported for hardware-
   accelerated drivers.
 - Added support for global configuration file, which works as configuration
   for all games and overrides default game's config file. Individual game
   user's config overrides global one in its turn. Global config's location is
   platform-dependent (this feature is currently disabled on Windows).
 - Implemented separate config option for game's shared data path, to keep it
   distinct from user-defined saves path.
 - Engine saves last Windowed and RenderAtScreenResolution mode states to the
   user config file.
 - Engine no longer writes and reads gamma level in saves, meaning that gamma
   keeps its current value when restoring a saved game.
 - Removed arbitrary limit on number of sprites rendered at the same time for
   hardware-accelerated renderers (Direct3D and OpenGL) (was 75), and another
   limit imposed on drawing entries for all drivers (was 200).
 - Engine now tries to get voice files from the Speech folder first, if one
   exists, and speech.vox later when quick-run from the Editor.
 - Fixed speech portrait was displayed below GUI, contrary to speech text.
 - Fixed ShakeScreen command was causing graphic artifacts when game is run
   with software renderer.
 - Fixed calling ChangeView during idle animation results in new view being animated.
 - Fixed Speech.SkipStyle getter return value for eSkipTime case.
 - Fixed Speech.VoiceMode not returning correct values when speech.vox is not
   enabled/present.
 - Fixed AdjustVolumeWithScaling character's property not working with the new
   audio system.
 - Fixed volume drop was not applied to audio clips which begin playing during
   speech voice-over.
 - Fixed Game.SetAudioTypeSpeechVolumeDrop did not affect currently playing
   clips until next voice-over begins.
 - Fixed Game.TranslationFilename returning "default" instead of empty string
   if no translation is set.
 - Fixed engine was trying to locate "My Documents" folder on Windows Vista and
   higher even though it did not need it, and reporting internal error if such
   folder was not found, even though "Saved Games" folder is used instead.
 - Properly toggle console upon play.debug_mode variable change in script.
 - Added missing stubs for agsjoy plugin.

WinSetup:
 - Fixed display mode selection was missing certain items.


VERSION 3.4.0 - Patch 4, March 2017

Editor:
 - Improved Font preview, now it displays all 256 supported characters and
   resizes itself to accomodate these on the grid properly.
 - Fixed game compilation on systems which have Japanese ANSI or similar locale
   as default locale for non-Unicode applications.
 - Fixed Linux binaries were not copied to the Compiled folder if AGS Editor is
   installed to "C:/Program Files" and run in a non-administrator mode.
  
Engine:
 - Fixed toggling mouse lock in window with Ctrl+Alt did not work all the time.

Common bug fixes:
 - Fixed program crash in Engine and Editor when loading/importing a game that
   contains file with name longer than 50 characters.

Editor bug fixes:
 - Do not copy hidden and system files into final directories when building the
   game.


VERSION 3.4.0 - Patch 2, February 2017

Script API:
 - Extended the list of System.OperatingSystem possible return values;
   now supports eOSAndroid, eOSiOS, eOSPSP

Editor bug fixes:
 - Fixed incorrect Unicode-to-ANSI string conversion during game compilation
   which caused text containing non-latin characters become random mess in game,
   even if game fonts compiled to the proper ANSI codepage.

Engine bug fixes:
 - Fixed mouse cursor stuck at the left border of the screen when using OpenGL
   renderer (Android & iOS ports).
 - Fixed InventoryScreen() script function caused game to crash if particular
   resources are not available.
 - Fixed built-in inventory screen not working with Direct3D and OpenGL
   renderers.
 - Fixed obsolete gfxfilter names are printed when using --help argument.

VERSION 3.2.2 Beta, July 2012:

Following changes made by Tzach Shabtay, unless noted otherwise.

Features:
- Added docking panels and Window menu to control all the windows.
- Added folders for characters, dialogs, inventory items, guis, rooms, scripts and views.
- Added new menu items for all folders to move up/down.
- Added the ability to drag/drop files to be before other files.
- Added highlights for drag&drop and auto-expand folders on hover during drag&drop.
- Script and header files are now combined into one and can be expanded/collapsed, similar to
  room settings & script.
- Removed the context menu commands to move script modules up/down, this can now be done with
  drag/drop (and not only for scripts). The script dependency rule remains the same
  (lower scripts can import symbols from upper ones, but not vice versa).
- Removed the "exclude script" option.
- The "Sort room by number" now sorts within folders.
- Added a menu item to find all usages for characters, dialogs, views,inventory items and
  global variables.
- Added a menu item for almost all document tabs, to navigate to their node on the project tree.
- Added "Goto line" dialog from script editor via shortcut Ctrl+G (and changed existing
  shortcuts to open global script & header to Ctrl+Shift+G/H).
- Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+M) to switch between header and source.
- Objects, characters and edges can now be moved with the arrows in the room editor.

Editor Plugin API:
- ISourceControlProvider interface for editor plugins to define your own source control provider
  (Michael Rittenhouse).

Mono Support:
- Partially disabled some features only when running with Mono, since I couldn't see a way to
  code them without the
  Win API:
   - Breaking in debug will not automatically set the editor to the foreground, the user might
     have to click on the window.
   - Notifying the user on file changes externally if the editor is in focus will not happen.
     It will happen when the window is activated, so I hope it won't be too annoying.

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed crash clicking in margin of dialog editor (Chris Jones).
- Fixed RGB colour picker not working in 256-col games with colour numbers > 32 (Chris Jones).
- Fix for: when moving an object after zooming in and out, the floating co-ordinates no longer
  appear next to the object.
- Fixed "Go-to definition" on global variables in script editor didn't do anything. It will now
  open the global variables editor and select the global variable.

VERSION 2.07 SR-2, May 2000
 - Added "unhandled_event" text script event, allows processing of events
   which the Interaction window doesn't handle.
 - Fixed problem with New Game, where the interface script wasn't set up
   properly.
 - Fixed NewRoomEx, to allow co-ordinates above 320x200 on scrolling rooms.
 - Fixed sprite import in hi-res screwing up palette.

 - Added option to not change inventory cursor to the item's graphic.
 - Right-clicking an inventory item in the lucasarts-style inventory now

   option colour, the highlight colour will be changed to purple.
 - Fixed bug with running text scripts for inventory items.
 - Fixed bug where "Buttons off when disabled" didn't work.

VERSION 2.07, April 2000
 - Completely re-written interface system - now called the GUI system instead.
   You may need to make some changes for your game to continue working with
   this version - see section 4.2.5 in the manual for what's changed.
 - Added text script functions GetCurrentMusic, SetMusicRepeat,
   SetMusicVolume, MoveCharacterDirect, ChangeCharacterView, PauseGame,
   UnPauseGame, LoseInventory, SetLabelText, FileWriteInt and FileReadInt.
 - Fixed bug where forward frame was displayed breifly whenever you walked
   anywhere.
 - Fixed bug with hit-testing on scaled characters.

 - Removed the Windows version until I can sort out the bugs in it.

VERSION 2.06 SR-1, March 2000
 - Added support for importing JASC (Paint Shop Pro) palette files.
 - Fixed bug where roomedit crashed if your game contained more than 80 files.

VERSION 2.06, March 2000
 - Added character numbers, so that characters can be moved/animated using
   the Animation Editor. Just use the character's number +100 as the object
   number. For example, use "Move To 100,50" with Object as 102 will move
   character 2. The Character Editor shows the character numbers.
 - Finally fixed the text size in high-resolution modes.
 - Added scroll bar to character editor, so you can now have up to 50 instead
   of 15 characters.
 - Added "Enters screen after fade-in" event, which works like the "Player
   enters screen" event except that it occurs after the screen has faded in.
 - Added text script functions AreCharObjColliding, Wait, DisableInterface,
   EnableInterface, SetBackgroundFrame, SetGlobalInt, GetGlobalInt.
 - Added option for instant-change between rooms instead of fading.

 - Fixed bug with CDAudio that was causing crashes.
 - Fixed bug which crashed sometimes when speech was displayed.
 - Fixed bug which gave screenful of cups in sprite manager (I think...)
 - Removed the "delete sprite" option because it was causing too many
   problems. To delete a sprite, simply import a 1x1 sprite on top of it.

VERSION 2.05 SR-2, February 2000
 - Fixed bug in roomedit with animating backgrounds
 - Allowed to get back into roomedit if error with dialog script; however,
   you must fix the error before you can save the game.
 - Fixed bug with animating background scenes in usergame.exe

VERSION 2.05 SR-1, February 2000
 - Added Undo feature to roomedit.
 - Added option to import/export dialogs to roomedit.
 - Fixed bug with full-screen preview in roomedit at 640x400 resolution.

VERSION 2.05, February 2000
 - Added animating background support! See section 3.3.5 in the docs.
 - RoomEdit now uses a crosshair mouse cursor when drawing walk-behinds and
   hotspots, to enable you to better see what's under the cursor.
 - Added support for importing a BMP/PCX file as the mask for hotspot/walk-
   behind/etc. See section 3.3.4 in the manual for information.
 - Added support for export/import of characters, which allows you to share
   characters between games and with others on the internet. The end of
   section 3.2.7 in the manual describes this.
 - Added support for importing JPGs as background scene.
 - RoomEdit now allows scrolling up/down the inventory list, so you can have
   more than 15 inventory items (max 99 now).
 - Customizable text speech speed - see the  game.text_speed  global variable
   description (section 6.4 of the docs).
 - Fixed bug where Sierra-style inventory window messed up in various
   circumstances.
 - Improved the room loading speed.
 - Added text script functions SetObjectPosition and AreObjectsColliding.
 - Added GetPalette and SetPalette text script functions, to allow you to
   do things to the entire palette. New variable type "palette", which you
   use with these functions.
 - Added Italian translation by Mario.
 - Removed the room password option: it was a left-over from AC v1, and now
   that you can build an exe file of your game, it's not really needed.
 - NOTE: The Windows version has not been updated to 2.05 - the included
   acwin.exe is still the v2.04 version. This is due to time constraints and
   pressure to release 2.05 as soon as possible; the Win version still has
   the room changing bug, so it's not worth including until I work on that.

VERSION 2.04, January 2000
 - Added Sierra-style close-up-face option for speech display in conversations.
 - Added object naming, so that moving the mouse over objects in a Lucasarts
   interface displays a proper name, instead of "OBJECT 0".
 - Added option to make a character invisible to the hit-testing, so that the
   main character can't be interacted with (like the Lucasarts games).
 - Added pixel-perfect click detection option, so that clicking a transparent
   pixel of an object/character doesn't trigger the interaction.
 - Added option to use top-left pixel of sprite as transparent colour instead
   of just colour index 0.
 - Added support for using a background picture for text windows. To use this,
   just go to your text-window interface in the Interface Editor, then right-
   click the background, choose Properties, then click the "COL/PIC" button
   and type the slot number you want to use. The picture will NOT be tiled
   or stretched (but it will be clipped to fit the window), so you should make
   sure it is large enough for the biggest text windows (about 250x100 should
   be enough).
 - Added ability to delete sprites in the Sprite Manager.
 - Added SaveScreenShot text script function.
 - Added option to treat Walk mode as a normal mode, so that the character
   isn't automatically moved but instead a normal event is triggered when
   you click to move.
 - Modified RoomEdit so that when you click a "Display Message" interaction
   command, it provides a list of messages in the room to choose from, instead
   of prompting you for the message number. If there are no messages it will
   ask for the number, just like before (this means you can still set up the
   interactions before actually typing the messages in, if you want to).
 - Fixed bug where the player lost the inventory item when Data 99 was used.
 - Made some improvements to the beta of the Windows version.

VERSION 2.03, November 1999
IMPORTANT: Your game, and all your room files, need to be upgraded to use the
latest version. To upgrade, simply load and save in the Room Editor. You must
do this for EVERY ROOM in your game. Sorry, but it's to support the upcoming
Windows version.
 - Allowed creation of very wide (eg. 700x200) lo-res scrolling rooms.
 - New text script functions MoveCharacterToHotspot, DisplaySpeech, NewRoomEx.
 - Lucasarts-style inventory window.
 - Changed background importing - now, it just asks what resolution the
   drawing is supposed to be, instead of trying to work it out. This allows
   scrolling rooms of any size in any resolution.
 - Changed the way the Room Editor works with games - instead of running it
   from the directory which the game is in, it creates each game a
   sub-directory below the main RoomEdit/AGS directory. This makes it much
   easier to edit the demo game, and should solve problems with files not
   being found and so on. What this means for you is that if you are working
   on a game with its files in the RoomEdit directory, create a sub-directory
   and copy all your game files (*.crm, ac2game.*, etc) into it.
   Another result of this is that the usergame.exe is now called by the game
   directory's name, and placed in the main AGS directory.
 - Non-player objects can now be moved with the animation command "Move to",
   and also with a new text script command MoveObject.
 - Added graphical script command "Run dialog" (it's under "Remove object" if
   you can't find it).
 - Added "Save room" as well as "Save room as" to Room Editor. This option
   saves back to the same file you loaded from, which is quicker than having
   to select the right file to save to every time.
 - Slightly modified the background scene remapper: it now puts the background
   colours starting from the end of the palette and working backwards; this
   makes it easier if you want to increase the number of sprite colours part
   way through making a game. Otherwise this change is transparent to you.
 - Added ability to "lock" objects in the Room Editor. While an object is
   locked, it cannot be moved around the screen. Useful if you keep getting the
   wrong object when you're trying to move a different one.
 - Increased a few limits: now 100 views, 200 dialog topic, 900 dialog messages.
 - Fixed bug where "music0.mp3 not found" flashed on the screen breifly.
 - Fixed the interface text @overhotspot@ to include object & character names.
 - Included beta version of Windows port! See AGSWIN.TXT for information.

VERSION 2.02, September 1999
 - Fixed bug where you were unable to save the game.
 - Character names can use lower case
 - New option "Player can't skip speech" prevents the player clicking away
   conversation text, like the way the Lucasarts games won't let you.
 - Character walks to the walk-to point of a hotspot in Walk mode (as well
   as use/speak mode). This makes it more like the Lucasarts interface.
 - Fixed SCI font importing bug, and added an Auto-Recover feature so that if
   it does crash in future, then it won't permanently disable the Fonts tab.
 - Added sprite import support for 640x400-resolution object graphics.
 - Added crash protection to the StrCat function, so that it won't add text
   past the maximum string length instead of crashing the system.
 - New MIDI driver: Software wavetable synth, uses the digital sound driver
   to play MIDI music using General MIDI patch set. By using this driver, your
   MIDI music can sound the same on ALL sound cards. See section 2.2.1 in the
   docs for information.
 - Changed the way that the mouse cursor hotspot setting works - it's clearer
   what's going on now.
 - Added engine debugging options. See the TECHDBG.TXT file for information.

VERSION 2.01, September 1999
NOTE: You will need to upgrade your game to use the new engine. To do this,
simply load the game into the Room Editor and then save it again.
 - Characters can now have a Talking view, which allows animation in dialogs
 - Fixed bug in dialogs where various messages screwed up
 - Fixed bug where interface text color was always black
 - Dialog options can now wrap to more than one line
 - Hotspot names can be longer and use lowercase
 - Fixed scaling bug where he sometimes popped up full-size briefly
 - Fixed crash if you pressed a key while in a conversation
 - Fixed background importing bug where colour index 0 screwed up
 - Added custom font support; but currently, you can only import SCI fonts.
 - Added graphical script command "If inventory %d was used"; allows you to
   use graphical scripts with Data-99 inventory events.
 - Documented RunDialog text script function
 - In View Editor, setting graphic for new frame zooms to previous frame's
   graphic in sprite list
 - User-defined gap between display of options in conversations
 - Interface button properties has "..." button to link to script editor if
   the left-click action is set to Run Script.
 - You can export the palette to PCX as well as PAL file.
 - When saving game, RoomEdit also checks for AC.EXE in the roomedit.exe
   directory as well as the current directory. So editing the demo by typing
   ..\roomedit will allow it to compile properly.
 - Fixed game loading bug where the graphical script timer wasn't restored
 - Allowed 320-width sprite import in room editor (if you drag the rectangle
   to screen width, it imports what's under the rectangle border as well as
   what's inside).

VERSION 2.00, September 1999
Complete re-write of both the Room Editor and the engine. Some of the new
features are:
 - Character scaling: man can get smaller as he walks away from the screen.
 - Customizable interface: you're not stuck with the Sierra one any more.
 - Non-player characters supported - this allows you to have other characters
   roaming the world and keep track of where they are.
 - Animating mouse cursors supported.
 - Scrolling rooms.
 - Conversations, like in Lucasarts games, with easy-to-use Dialog Editor.
 - Conditions for clicking on player character - you no longer have to display
   a message.
 - Much more powerful text script: you can do a lot more with it.
 - Increased max loops per view to 8 instead of 4.
 - Customizable walking speed for main character.
 - Baselines for objects, useful for objects lying flat on the ground, so that
   the man doesn't walk behind them.
 - You can change the icon bar graphics.
 - You can build a single EXE file for your game. This goes one step further
   than the data file you could build in the last version.
 - Improved remapping of scenes and sprites, solves most of the palette
   problems people were having with importing their graphics.
 - Clarified LICENSE.TXT. You should read the new license agreement.

VERSION 1.14a, May 1999
 - Fixed bug with Lose Game where the LOSE.PCX wasn't being shown, and it
   called it an "internal error".
 - Fixed bug where the engine refused to run if you didn't have a sound card.
 - Added German and Dutch translations by Erix Designs, Spanish translation by
   Ernesto Couso Artiles, and French translation by Pierre-Marc Jobin.
 - The introduction messages are now translated.
 - Fixed graphical script bug, where the flags weren't always initialized to
   the CLEAR state.
 - Fixed "sound2.voc not found" in the Showoff demo game.

VERSION 1.14, April 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile games made with previous versions.
NOTE: Old save game positions cannot be loaded.
 - Complete overhaul of the text script system. If you were using text
   scripts, see section 3.8.5 for how to upgrade. Many new commands and
   built-ins are available, see section 4.4 in the docs for a complete list.
 - You can now change the main character's graphics within different areas
   of the same screen. Section 3.13.1 in the docs describes this.
 - You can customize the score sound and the red-X sound. See ScoreSoundCustom
   and ErrorSoundCustom in section 4.1 of the docs.
 - Added support for customizable borders for the text windows. Section 4.1.1
   in the docs explains how to use this feature.
 - Added option to move man as close as possible to destination instead of
   displaying red X. See "MoveNearest" in section 4.1 of the docs for info.
 - Added XM music support. See section 3.2 of the docs.
 - The intro system has been changed. Now, the games starts in INTRO.CRM if
   it exists rather than displaying PIC1.PCX. See section 3.15 in the docs.
   The demo game intro now has two screens.
 - You can now change music volume on a per-room basis. This allows you to
   have, for example, quieter music outside a building than when the player
   enters it (like with the shops in the arcade in SQ4).
 - New graphical script commands: "Start timer", "when timer expires" and "move
   man to object". See section 4.6 in the docs.
 - New animation command "place object" allows you to instantly move an object
   to another position (see section 4.5 in the docs).
 - Added Swedish translation by Arn.
 - Fixed bug where man would 'moonwalk' when he reached destination (I think -
   still waiting for confirmation that this is fixed).
 - Mod musics are now included in your data file (sorry about that!).
 - Objects are now drawn behind the status bar if they are that high up.
 - Fixed bug causing mouse droppings to be left on the screen when the player
   scored points.
 - Fixed bug where you had to click twice to make the man walk off the left
   and bottom of the screen.
 - Fixed bug in RoomMake where the load/save room dialogs could 'disappear'.
 - Fixed lsl3-type score ticking (it works now!)
 - Fixed text colour problem in restore/save/quit dialogs.
 - Fixed spelling of "perhaps" on the second screen of the demo. At last!

VERSION 1.13, March 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games made with previous versions.
NOTE: You cannot load old save game positions saved before this version.
 - Added "every time player enters screen" and "repeatedly execute" events. See
   section 4.3 in the docs for information.
 - Added "move to, ignoring walls" animation command, allows you to give the
   effect of the character walking through a door otherwise blocked, etc.
   Also, you can now set a repeating animation in the Animation Editor. See
   section 4.5 in the docs for info.
 - New Sierra-style inventory window! See section 4.1.3 in the docs for how to
   implement this.
 - Added graphical script commands "If player has inventory item", "Lose
   inventory item", "Every x loops" and "Random chance". See section 4.6 in
   the documentation for more info.
 - You can now use your own custom mouse cursors. See "Cursor" in section 4.1
   of the documentation.
 - Different cursor now used in dialog boxes and the like, allows for a proper
   walk cursor which isn't used everywhere else.
 - NEW: Windows version of the Project Manager.
 - The route-finder is now much quicker at working out whether you can get
   to the destination, so clicking on walls no longer pauses the game for ages.
 - New: MOD support for background music. You can now use mod files as well
   as midi files. See section 3.2 in the docs.
 - The "Go to screen" command is finally implemented in graphical scripts.
 - New: Global flags in graphical scripts. The demo game now demonstrates
   this (the cigarette appears on the bin screen once you've given the key
   to the man).
 - Choice of two fonts for the speech text - the original one or now an SQ4
   type speech font as well. See "SpeechFont" in section 4.1 of the docs.
 - The status bar is now fully (well, almost!) customizable. Section 4.1.2 in
   the docs describes how to do this.
 - You can change the colour and style of the message boxes. See section 4.1.1
   in the docs for info.
 - You can set messages to be removed after a time if the player has not
   clicked the mouse - useful for intros/animations/etc. See the end of
   section 2.5 in the docs for info.
 - The Sprite Manager can now scroll up/down if you have more sprites than fit
   on the screen. The maximum is now 500 imported sprites.
 - When the character dies, you can now have a "Restore or quit" dialog rather
   than exiting the game.
 - You can now draw double-thickness walls in the Room Editor. This saves a lot
   of time so you don't have to draw walls twice.
 - Speech text is now centred horizontally on the screen.
 - The score is not displayed in the status bar if TotalScore is set to 0.
   This allows for some games where you don't want to use the scoring system.
 - You can now set the icon bar to display on top of the status bar, instead
   of below it. See IconBarAbsTop in section 4.1 of the docs for info.
 - You can change the animation speed of the main character. Useful if you are
   using custom character graphics. See ManAnimSpeed in sect 4.1 in the docs.
 - The up/down facing view is now used when the character is going more
   vertically than horizontally, instead of only when going North or South.
 - Using foreign characters in save game descriptions no longer crashes.
 - The icon bar is now not displayed while the status bar is disabled.
 - Added Green speech text colour option. Oh yes!
 - In the demo game, once the door is unlocked you can now go through it by
   using the hand cursor.
 - A couple of people reported that their graphics cards couldn't do 640x400.
   Now, if RoomMake can't use 640x400 it will use a 640x480 mode with black
   borders at the top and bottom.
 - Added teleport-to-room command in debug mode lets you test things without
   having to play your whole game through.
 - The main character's colours have been slightly changed. He doesn't look as
   good now, but it stops the problems which were happening to some scenes.
 - The Room Editor can no longer save old format room files :-(  But I don't
   think you really want to go back to v1.00 now, do you?
 - Fixed bug causing colours 190 and 191 to be overridden (thanks Arn!).
 - Fixed bug where changing screen the main character would temporarily change
   to the standard front view.
 - Fixed bug where objects positions weren't saved if they were turned off.
 - Fixed bug in save games with some text scripts.
 - Fixed room loading bug which showed up occasionally on graphical scripts.
 - Fixed crash which happened when pressing the down arrow key in the Restore
   game dialog when there were no save games (yes, arcane but true! try it on
   an older version and see!)

VERSION 1.12a, February 1999
NOTE: You cannot load old save game positions saved before this version.
 - You can now move non-player objects with the "Move object" animation
   command.
 - Non-player objects are now drawn correctly when in walk-behind areas.
 - Fixed the bug where objects sometimes weren't being removed from the screen
   properly, like the poster in the demo game.
 - Better screen-changing routine which fades in with the objects on, so you
   don't get that sudden change effect.
 - Changing the man's graphics now actually works.
 - The current MIDI track and position are now saved in the save games. Woohoo!

VERSION 1.12, February 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games made with versions before this.
NOTE: You cannot load old save game positions saved before this version.
 - Added ability to change main character's graphic. See section 3.10 in the
   documentation for more information.
 - Added FLI/FLC animation support
 - Added simple animation support, so you can have, for example, a door
   actually opening. See section 3.11 in the documentation for info.
 - You can use Data column values in graphical script
 - New response "Turn object on" allows you to put back an object you removed
   with "Remove object".
 - You can now disable the main character in a room - this allows you to do
   things like close-ups of a control panel. This is now demonstrated in the
   demo game, and described in section 3.12.
 - You can now set an object to initally off in RoomMake, which you can turn
   on later using "Turn object on".
 - Added Finnish translation by Teemu Eramaa and Norwegian translation by
   Martin Seterstoen.
 - You can now import a portion of a PCX/BMP for object graphics. This allows
   you to draw several frames in one file, and then import each frame from the
   same graphic.
 - New option in the Sprite Manager allows you to use full 256-colour palette
   for imports if the graphic will only be used in one room. (This prevents
   the mapping to greyscale).
 - The Sprite Manager importer now preserves colour 0 (transparent) pixels in
   the imported image.
 - You can change the background music through a command as well as with the
   room option.
 - Improved message editor allows you to edit existing messages without having
   to re-type the whole thing and also allows longer messages.
 - Tweaked the auto-route finder: removed the bug where he would sometimes
   walk further than you asked, and shortened the time the routefinder is
   allowed before giving up. This means that it is quicker realizing that you
   can't get somewhere, but it may not be able to work out a path round
   complex obstacles.
 - Pressing 'N' in object editor now uses Sprite manager to select graphic
   instead of cycling through all available graphs.
 - Fixed a silly bug with the Go-to-screen data column value where he would
   appear on the wrong side.
 - The walk and hand icons have now been replaced.
 - Slowed down the animation speed of the main character, so he looks more
   like he's walking.
 - F1 now works in the Sprite Manager! Oh yes!
 - Fixed bug in RoomMake which crashed when you moved the mouse to the bottom
   of the screen.

VERSION 1.1, January 1999
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games made with versions before this
version. If you do not, you will not be able to run the game with this version.
NOTE: The files needed to distribute your games have changed. Please see
section 6.2 of the docs for information.
 - Added SVGA support. Background scenes can now be up to 640x400 256-colour!
   Please read section 3.9 in AC.DOC for notes on this new feature.
 - Added background music support, using MIDI files (see section 3.2 of AC.DOC
   for information).
 - Added sound effect support (see section 4.2 in AC.DOC for info).
 - Character movement by mouse added: click on the destination and he will
   walk there, as in Sierra's VGA games.
 - New compression algorithm for room files, leading to smaller files. In fact,
   the room file is now sometimes smaller than the imported scene's PCX file!
 - Foreign language support added.
 - Portuguese translation by Nuno Costa.
 - You can now import your own PCX/BMP files as graphics for objects.
 - Support for animating background sprites added. SUPPORT is the key word
   here, because currently I've only drawn one animating sprite.
 - The first screen of the demo has been changed to show off SVGA and
   animating sprites. And it looks better like this.
 - Expanded text script to make it more powerful. It still doesn't rival AGI
   for power, but you can now print out variable values and do crude intro
   sequences. See section 4.4 in the documentation for information.
 - New, much better icons for the top icon bar.
 - Slowed down the time-of-day to a fixed rate (on fast systems it was
   changing from day to night to day far too quickly).
 - Keypad 5 now stops the character walking properly.
 - Ported the run-time engine to DJGPP (a 32-bit DOS system).
 - You can now remove the status bar. Wow!

SERVICE RELEASE 1, December 1998
NOTE: Save games created by this release are not readable with previous
versions; and this version cannot load old save games. Sorry. If you try to
load an old game, you'll get Oops error 600. This is the price of progress :-)
You CAN, however, still use old rooms (so you haven't lost anything - phew!)
 - Added graphical script editor to RoomMake. This allows easy advanced
   scripting without using the .SCR file. See the AC.DOC file for more info.
 - RoomMake has been ported to DPMI. No more memory problems running RoomMake!
 - RoomMake now has an improved user interface:
    * a new file selector which allows changing directory and is easier to use
    * improved other dialogs, such as the "Are you sure you want to Quit"
      dialog and the "enter password" dialog.
    * supports long filenames if run under Windows 95, 98, or LFNDOS.
    * better palette remapping when reading in a PCX file.
    * supports importing BMP files as a background scene
 - The old screen now fades out and the new one in when changing screens.
 - Corrected the bug which caused a crash if you used an object with certain
   graphics.
 - Corrected the crash which occured if the script file was newer than the
   compiled file (thanks Luke!)
 - One extra screen has been added to the demo game, and it now ends
   gracefully instead of with a Load_Room error.

REVISION 10.07.97
NOTE: You will need to re-compile any games you made with any versions
before revision 10.07.97.A.
 - added StartPos option to INI file, to define where the man starts on
   the first screen. Also fixed the jump which happened when he first moved
   from the beginning.
 - removed the 'please register' nag screen, since I've decided that the
   Adventure Creator is now swap-ware (see LICENSE.TXT for info).

VERSION 1.00, FEBRUARY 1997
Original release.
