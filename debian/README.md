#Building the engine on any Linux
On Debian/Ubuntu, building a package (see below) is recommended.
On other distributions, install development files of the following
libraries. (In brackets are versions that are known to work, but other
versions should work, too.)

-   Allegro 4 (> 4.2.2)
-   libaldmb (0.9.3)
-   libdumb (0.9.3)
-   libfreetype (2.4.9)
-   libogg (1.2.2-1.3.0)
-   libtheora (1.1.1-1.2.0)
-   libvorbis (1.3.2)

Download the sources with git and change into the **ags** directory:

    git clone git://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags.git
    cd ags

If you are on a 64 bit system, check out the *64bit* branch:

    git checkout 64bit

Compile the engine:

    make --directory=Engine --file=Makefile.linux

The **ags** executable can now be found in the **Engine** folder and
can be installed with

    sudo make --directory=Engine --file=Makefile.linux install

Please take note of the usage instructions at the end of this document.


#Building a Debian/Ubuntu package of AGS
Building a package is the preferred way to install software on
Debian/Ubuntu. On 32 bit systems, this works just fine with the
*main* branch. On 64 bit systems, there are two possible ways
to do this. First, you can use the experimental *64bit* branch. Second,
the development versions of Debian and Ubuntu support parallel
installation of both 32 and 64 bit versions of all required libraries
(multiarch), so you can also use the more stable *main* branch there and build a 
32 bit AGS to use on your 64 bit system.


##Getting and updating the sources

###First time
    git clone git://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags.git
    cd ags
    debian/rules get-orig-source

If you want to build a native 64 bit AGS, check out the *64bit* branch:

    git checkout 64bit
    debian/rules get-orig-source

###Updating (with clean working directory)
    git pull
    debian/rules get-orig-source

###Matching working directory and orig tarball
To build the package, it is important that the working directory has
the same content as the tarball that is created from the git content
with `debian/rules get-orig-source`.

To ensure this, check if the working directory is clean with

    git status

If there are changes, run 

    debian/rules clean 

and/or

    git reset --hard HEAD

If there are still untracked files, delete them manually.

Run `debian/rules get-orig-source` every time the sources change. If
you want to change the sources yourself, you have to commit the
changes to git before running `debian/rules get-orig-source` and
building the package.


##Building the package

###Native AGS package
So you want to build on a 32 bit system or a 64 bit AGS on a 64 bit system.
Make sure you are in the right git branch (see above).

Install build dependencies and devscripts:

    sudo apt-get install devscripts debhelper pkg-config liballegro4.2-dev libaldmb1-dev libfreetype6-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libogg-dev

Build the package and install it and its dependencies with gdebi:

    cd ags
    debuild
    sudo gdebi ../ags_3.21.1115~JJS-1_i386.deb

###32 bit AGS on 64 bit system

This part works only on Debian sid and wheezy and Ubuntu quantal.

Enable multiarch:

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    sudo apt-get update

Install and prepare pbuilder (use the same distribution you are using,
i.e. `sid`, `wheezy` or `quantal`):

    sudo apt-get install pbuilder
    sudo pbuilder create --distribution sid --architecture i386

This creates an i386 chroot which will be used to build the i386 package
on an amd64 system. pbuilder automatically manages the build dependencies.
The pbuilder base can later be updated with

    sudo pbuilder update

Build the package with pbuilder and install it and its dependencies with gdebi:

    cd ags
    pdebuild
    sudo gdebi /var/cache/pbuilder/result/ags_3.21.1115~JJS-1_i386.deb


#Using the engine

To start an AGS game, just run ags with the game directory or the game
file as parameter, e.g.

    ags /path/to/game/

or

    ags game.exe

The configuration file **acsetup.cfg** in the game directory will be used
if present. Sometimes a configuration file coming with a game can cause problems,
so if a game doesn't start, try deleting **acsetup.cfg** first.

For midi music playback, you have to download GUS patches. We recommend
"Richard Sanders's GUS patches" from this address:

http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html

A direct link is here:

http://www.eglebbk.dds.nl/program/download/digmid.dat

Rename that file to **patches.dat** and place it directly into your home folder.
