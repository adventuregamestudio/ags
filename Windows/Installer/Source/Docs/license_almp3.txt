with Allegro and DOS) of this one is available in the decoder directory.

AllegroMP3 uses code from:
  - Xing Technology MPEG-Audio decoder part of
  - xingmp3-1.0.0-pre library


How to compile the library and example code:

  If you are running under a un*x system first run fixunix.sh
  If you want to use the DOS/Windows the pack is ready to be used
  as is right now, no conversion needed. fixdos.bat is only provided
  to be used if you used fixunix.sh to change file formats to unix one
  and you want them to be DOS format back again. Note that to use fixdos.bat
  you will need utod.exe.


  In case you are using GCC (DJGPP, MINGW32):

  Then edit the makefile and uncomment the target you want to compile to then run in the command
  line "make" and that's all.

  It will generate a library (libalmp3.a) ready to use in your programs

  After that, if you want to compile the example, get inside the directory
  example, edit the makefile uncommenting the target you want to compile to
  and type "make".


  In case you are using Microsoft Visual C++:

  Open the project file and build, it will
