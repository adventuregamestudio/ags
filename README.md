##Issue tracker

Please report bugs and feature requests at the [AGS Issue Tracker](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/yabb/index.php?action=projects)!

## Contributing

We are happy about every contributor, so if you want to help out, you can get commit access to the [adventuregamestudio/ags](https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags) repository.

There is also always the possibility of pushing changes to a personal fork and then creating a pull request.
This is also a good idea if you have commit access, but feel that changes you made should be reviewed before inclusion.

The [main](https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags/tree/main) branch should be kept in a working state and always compilable on all targeted platforms.
Larger changes that potentially break things temporarily should first be made in [refactory](https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags/tree/refactory) (for refactoring) and other branches or in personal forks.

##AGS game compatibility:

This runtime engine port is not compatible with all AGS games. There are the
following restrictions:

-   Supported AGS versions right now are all starting from 2.50 even though
    running games below version 3.2x is experimental.
    You can check the version of AGS a game was made with by examining the properties 
    of the game executable.
    If you try to run a game made with a newer or older version of AGS, you will
    receive an error when trying to launch the game.
-   Savegames are compatible between the different platforms if they are created
    with the same engine version.
-   Games that depend on plugins for which there is no platform-independent
    replacement will not load.
