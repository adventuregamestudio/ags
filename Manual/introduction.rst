Welcome to AGS!

Adventure Game Studio allows you to create your own point-and-click adventure
games like the old Sierra and Lucasarts classics, but with modern features
such as digital music and alpha blending.

AGS is based around an easy-to-use IDE, where you can set up all the parts of
your game, and then add some script to process game events. Making a game
has never been so productive!

To get started, :ref:`read the tutorial <StartingOff>`.

System Requirements
===================

To run the Editor, you need a Windows-based PC with at least 128 MB RAM and
the .NET 2.0 Framework installed (games you create do **NOT** require the framework).

Any games you create have at least these system requirements:


* Pentium or higher processor
* 64 Mb RAM
* Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista, Seven with DirectX 5 or above
* Supports all DirectX-compatible sound and video cards


Depending on your game's resolution and colour depth, you may have higher requirements.
The processor required is as follows:


* 320x200, 256-colour:  Any Pentium-class system
* 640x400, 256-colour:  266 Mhz or above
* 800x600, 256-colour:  500 Mhz or above recommended
* 320x200, 16-bit colour:  233 Mhz or above
* 640x400, 16-bit colour:  500 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if you use large objects
* 800x600, 16-bit colour:  600 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if you use large objects
* 320x200, 32-bit colour:  300 Mhz or above
* 640x400, 32-bit colour:  700 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if you use large objects
* 800x600, 32-bit colour:  900 Mhz system minimum, may need faster if you use large objects


These requirements are not an exact science though - game speed is affected by many
factors, including how many objects/characters are on the screen, whether background music
is playing, the complexity of your scripts, and more. The best way to determine the requirements
of your game are to test it on different computer configurations.
