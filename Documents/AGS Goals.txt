// GOALS:
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Separate underlying utility libraries from the project, make them static libraries.



2. Replace direct use of Allegro and other third-party libs with use of interfaces.



3. Separate any platform-dependant code from engine core, move it to platform-specific
code units, probably hide beyond interfaces.



4. Free engine data structures from the size/data offset restrictions.

    Blocking problems:
    4.1. Many structures are read/written by script runtime directly, variables being
    accessed by offsets, arrays of game objects return elements by offset which depends
    on object's size (? - need checking). See p.5.
    4.2. Backwards compatibility! The structures must know how to read data of older
    versions. See p.6.
    
    After this is done the engine classes could be altered any way we please.



5. Alter script runtime (interpreter) so that it substitutes direct access to game objects
by offset with something else, like add get/set methods to classes that read/write certain
variables deducted by given "legacy" offset.
Either do that "on run", or convert old script's byte-code to newer version on load.



6. All structs and classes should be able to read/write their states in two cases:
loading/saving game data and loading/saving running game state (savegame).
They should be able to detect older version of data format and make appropriate
conversions.



7. Utility classes for safer code:
    7.1. String
    7.2. Array/pointer array/list
    7.3. File
    7.4. Stream (and descendants like FileStream)
         with support for explicitly defined endianess and padding control (for backward-compatible reading)
