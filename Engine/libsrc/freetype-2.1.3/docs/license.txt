FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one which
fits your needs best:

  . The FreeType License, in file `docs/FTL.txt'.

  . The GNU General Public License, in file `docs/GPL.txt'.

The contributed PCF driver comes with a license similar to that of X Window
System which is compatible to the above two licenses (see file
src/pcf/readme).
