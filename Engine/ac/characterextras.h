// CharacterExtras is a separate runtime character data. Historically it was
// separated from the design-time CharacterInfo, because the latter is exposed
// to script API and plugin API in such way that its memory layout could not
// be changed at all. Although, today this is less of an issue (see comment
// to CharacterInfo).
//
// TODO: in the long run it will be beneficial to remake this into a more
// explicit runtime Character class, while perhaps keeping CharacterInfo only
// to load design-time data.
