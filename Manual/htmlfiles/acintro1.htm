      <h2 align="center"><b>Getting Started with AGS</b></h2>
      <p>So, you've downloaded AGS. You want to make an adventure game. But 
		where do you start?
      </p>
      <p>(<b><i>NOTE</i></b>: before we start, this tutorial was made using v3.0 
		of AGS. If you have a newer version, there may be minor inconsistencies 
		in the screenshots where extra options have been added and so forth, but 
		most of what's here should still apply).
      </p>
      <h3>Creating the game
      </h3>
      <p align="left" dir="ltr">Start up the AGS Editor by double-clicking the
		<i>AGSEditor.exe</i> file, and you should be greeted by the following 
		screen:
      </p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro1.jpg" width="422" height="334"><br>
            <i>The &quot;Welcome to AGS&quot; dialog</i>
      </p>
      <p align="left" dir="ltr">Make sure that &quot;Start a new game&quot; is selected, 
		and click Continue. You'll be presented with the Create New Game wizard:
      </p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro1a.jpg" width="437" height="294"><br>
      <i>Create New Game dialog</i>
      </p>
      <p align="left">So, without further ado, click Next, and you'll see the 
		Select Template screen:</p>
		<p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro1b.jpg" width="437" height="294"><br>
      	<i>Select Template dialog</i> </p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr">Here, you need to choose which template you're 
		going to use for your new game. AGS comes with several ones, and you can find 
		others for download on the AGS Forums.</p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr">The &quot;Sierra-style&quot; template is what we'll be 
		using, as it has classic Sierra adventure game UI and comes with some default
		graphics to get you started quickly.
		The &quot;Empty Game&quot; template is something you may want to use 
		later on when you're familiar with AGS - it comes with no default 
		graphics at all.</p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr">So, select &quot;Sierra-style&quot; and click Next.</p>
		<p align="center" dir="ltr">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro1c.jpg" width="437" height="294"><br>
      	<i>Game Name dialog</i> </p>
      <p align="left" dir="ltr">Finally, you need to decide on what to call your game. 
		In the first box you can type the full name for your game. This is what 
		will be displayed in the game title bar when it's running in a window, 
		and it's used for a couple of other things too. For the purposes of this 
		tutorial, I'm going to call it the incredibly lame &quot;Roger's Adventure&quot;, 
		but you can use whatever you like.</p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr">The second box asks you for the game <i>file 
		name. </i>This is only used for the name of 
		the folder that your game is created in, and the name of the final EXE 
		file you compile.</p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr">The third box allows you to choose where AGS 
		should put the game files -- the default is your My Documents folder, 
		and I'm going to stick with that.</p>
		<p align="left" dir="ltr">Click the <i>Finish</i> button, and after a 
		short wait you should be presented with the main AGS Editor window:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro2.jpg" width="633" height="449"><br>
            <i>The main editor window</i></p>
      <p dir="ltr">So, there's your new game, ready and waiting for you to 
		create it!</p>
      <h3>Starting off&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>The main way that you navigate around the editor is using the <b>
		project tree</b> in the top-right corner, which allows you to access all 
		the various parts of your game. Let's start by scrolling to the top of 
		the tree, and double-clicking the &quot;General Settings&quot; node:</p>
		<p dir="ltr" align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro3.jpg" width="633" height="449"><br>
            <i>The General Settings pane</i></p>
		<p dir="ltr">This screenshot demonstrates three of the main editor 
		features. The <b>project tree</b>, as we've already discussed, gives you 
		access to the various parts of your game. The <b>property grid</b>, in 
		the bottom-right, is where item-specific properties are accessed. It's 
		not used in the Game Settings window, but we'll see it in action soon!</p>
		<p dir="ltr">Finally, the AGS editor allows you to have several windows 
		open at once, and they are &quot;tabbed&quot; across the <b>open windows</b> bar 
		at the top so that you can easily switch between them. Use the Close 
		button to close a window once you're finished with it.</p>
		<p>Now, since we're on the Settings pane, let's briefly examine the 
		various options we have in front of us. Make sure these options are 
		enabled to begin with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Enable Debug Mode</b> - Since we are going to be developing the 
		game, we want the assistance of the debug features in the engine. This 
		allows you to do things like teleport to different rooms, give yourself 
		all the inventory items, and so forth. You would un-check this before 
		compiling the final version of the game when it's complete.</li>
        <li><b>Enable 'anti-glide' mode</b> - without it, the character movement 
		can look somewhat silly.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Pixel-perfect click detection</b> - improves the game playability 
		by making sure that clicking transparent regions of objects won't 
		trigger them.</li>
        <li><b>Characters turn before walking</b> - if the character is facing 
		right, and you click to move him left, he'll rotate round before 
		starting to move. This is what the Sierra and Lucasarts point-and-click 
		games did, and looks a bit more professional.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personally, I would always enable these four options when starting a 
		new game. As you get a feel for AGS, you can decide what suits you best, 
		and change these options again later.</p>
      <h3>Colour choices</h3>
      <p>Now, at this stage we really need to decide whether we want to create a 
		palette-based (8-bit, 256-colour) game, or a hi-color (16- or 32-bit) 
		game. It's highly recommended that you go with 16-bit colour, or 32-bit 
		if you want to use alpha transparency.</p>
		<p>256-colour games are much more complicated to make due to having to 
		deal with the palette, they are not supported by the Direct3D driver, 
		and may not run well on some modern graphics cards. Although they can 
		give you the authentic retro feel, unless you really need to use 
		palette-cycling effects, it's recommended that you stay away from making 
		new 256-colour games.</p>
		<p>Still, I'll cover both methods briefly below; if you're not really sure which 
		to choose, go for Hi-color (16-bit) since it provides a good balance of 
		performance and ease-of-use. If you want to be able to use alpha-channel 
		image transparency, use 32-bit colour.</p>
      <p><i>(NOTE: We need to decide now because when you import graphics, they 
		will be set to the game's colour depth. Should you change your mind 
		later, you would have to re-import all the graphics).</i></p>
      <h3>Creating a 256-colour game&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>Double-click the &quot;Colours&quot; node in the project tree. You should see 
		this:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro4.jpg" width="633" height="449"><br>
      <i>The Palette Editor</i></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The palette display has a grid with the 256 colour slots on 
		it. The first 40 colours are<b> game-wide</b> colours, which means that 
		those palette slots have a fixed colour throughout the game, in every 
		single room.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">The remaining slots, marked &quot;X&quot;, are <b>background</b>
      colours and vary from room to room. This allows for different types of 
		background to use different ranges of colours.</p>
      <p>The default palette setup is a little badly weighted. Your GUI and main 
		character graphics will have to use just the game-wide colours, since 
		they are shown in more than one room. Therefore, unless you want a 
		greyscale main character, the colours displayed are probably not enough.</p>
      <p>So, let's swap some background colours for some game-wide ones. Select 
		the first &quot;X&quot; slot, then hold shift and click on the last slot in the 
		row marked &quot;80&quot;. The screen should look as follows:</p>
      <p align="center">
		<img border="0" src="images/intro5.jpg" width="633" height="449"><br>
      <i>We have selected colours 42-95</i></p>
      <p dir="ltr">We can now see the Property Grid in action. Change the &quot;ColourType&quot; 
		setting from &quot;Background&quot; to &quot;Gamewide&quot;, and you'll see the selected &quot;X&quot;s 
		turn into various colours.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">If you select one of these colours you'll see its RGB colour 
		values in the property grid, where you can adjust the colour of that 
		slot. If you don't want to do this manually for every colour, you can 
		set up slots 42-95 in another paint package, save a BMP file, and then 
		right-click on the selected slots and choose the &quot;Replace selected slots 
		from file&quot; option.</p>
      <p>What colours you use is up to you, and depends on what sort of colour 
		scheme you're going for with your graphics.</p>
      <table border="0" id="table3">
        <tr>
          <td valign="top">
			<img border="0" src="images/icon_info.gif" align="top" width="32" height="32"></td>
          <td>
			<p dir="ltr">You should set up the palette as well as you can now, 
			because changing it later may require you to re-import some 
			graphics.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Creating a 16-bit or 32-bit colour game</h3>
      <p>Back on the Game Settings pane, check out the very top option in the 
		list. It's called &quot;Colour depth&quot;, and all you have to do is change it to 
		your desired colour depth. A warning message will prompt you to make 
		sure. Confirm it, and you're done.</p>
      <h3>Game Resolution</h3>
      <p>Having decided on our colour depth, the other important decision to 
		make at this stage is what resolution we want the game to run at. Higher 
		resolutions allow you to have more detailed graphics, but they need more 
		memory and run slower than lower resolutions.</p>
		<p>Go back to the General Settings pane, and select your chosen 
		resolution from the &quot;Resolution&quot; drop-down list.</p>
