// CCStaticArray manages access to an array of script objects,
// where an element's size counted by script's bytecode may differ from the
// real element size in the engine's memory.
// The purpose of this is to remove size restriction from the engine's structs
// exposed to scripts.
//
// FIXME: [ivan-mogilko] the above was meant to work, but in reality it doesn't
// and won't, at least not without some extra workarounds.
// The problem that I missed here is following:
//   when the script compiler is told to get an Nth element of a global struct
//   array, such as character[n], it calculates the memory address as
//   array address + sizeof(Character) * n.
//   If this address is used for the read/write operations, these ops can be
//   intercepted by interpreter and remapped into the real fields
//      (see IScriptObject::ReadN, WriteN interface)
//   But if this address is used IN POINTER COMPARISON, then we cannot do
//   anything. And if our real struct in the engine is stored on a different
//   relative memory offset than one expected by compiler, then this pointer
//   comparison will fail, e.g. script expression like
//      if (player == character[n])
//
// NOTE: on the other hand, similar effect could be achieved by separating
// object data into two or more structs, where "base" structs are stored in
// the exposed arrays (part of API), while extending structs are stored
// separately. This is more an issue of engine data design.
