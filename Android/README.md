#Using the engine


##Adding games to the game list

By default games have to be placed into the external storage device. This is
usually the SD-card, but this can vary.

Place the game into the directory

    <EXTERN>/ags/<GAME NAME>/

<GAME NAME> is what will be displayed in the game list.



##Game options

Global options can be configured by pressing the MENU button on the game list
and choosing the "Preferences" item. These settings apply to all games unless
they have their own custom preferences set.

By performing a longclick on a game entry in the list, a menu opens that lets
you choose custom preferences specifically for that game.

In the same menu you can also choose "Continue" to resume the game from
your last savegame.



##Controls

-   Finger movement: Moving the mouse cursor
-   Single finger tap: Perform a left click
-   Tap with two fingers: Perform a right click
-   Longclick: Hold down the left mouse button until tapping the screen again
-   MENU button: Opens a menu for key input and quitting the game
-   MENU button longpress: Opens and closes the onscreen keyboard
-   BACK button: Sends ESC key command to the game
-   BACK button longpress: "Quit game" dialog




##Downloading prebuilt engine packages

Go to http://jjs.at/daily to download the installation package for the current
source snapshot.



##MIDI playback

For midi music playback, you have to download GUS patches. We recommend
"Richard Sanders's GUS patches" from this address:

http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html

A direct link is here:

http://www.eglebbk.dds.nl/program/download/digmid.dat

Rename that file to **patches.dat** and place it into the **ags**
directory alongside your games.



#Building the engine

The Android app consists of three parts, each with different requirements:

-   Java app: needs the Android SDK for Windows, Linux or Mac
-   Native engine library: needs the Android NDK for Windows, Linux or Mac
-   Native 3rd party libraries: needs the Android NDK for Linux

To only build the app, first follow the "Native engine library" and then the "Java app"
instructions below.

##Java app

There are two parts to the Java app, one is the engine library in <SOURCE>/Android/library
and the other one is the launcher app. The default launcher which displays a list
of games from the SD-card is in <SOURCE>/Android/launcher_list.

The easiest way to build the app is to create an Android project in Eclipse. Choose the
"create from existing source" option and point Eclipse to the launcher directory.

To build from the command line, you can use the tool 'ant'.

    $ export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk-linux
    $ cd <SOURCE>/Android/launcher_list
    $ ant debug
    $ ant release # for release build

##Native engine library

This is the main AGS engine code. It must be compiled using the Android NDK. This can
simply be done by running ndk-build within the <SOURCE>Android/library directory. 

e.g. (assuming the ndk is installed in /opt)

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/opt/android-ndk-r10e
    $ cd <SOURCE>/Android/library
    $ ndk-build

The native code is built for all current Android architecture, that is armv6, armv7-a,
x86 and mips.


##Native 3rd party libraries

You don't have to build these yourself unless you want to change the source code of
a library.

Change to the <SOURCE>/Android/buildlibs directory and run

    ./buildall.sh

This will download, patch, build and properly install the required libraries.

The scripts require standalone toolchains for all Android platforms and they have to
be available on the PATH. See https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain.html
for instructions on creating the standalone toolchains.

Libraries must be available in <SOURCE>/libsrc
